Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
SITUATION REPORT - 3,
23 JANUARY 2020,
Data as reported by: 23 January 20201,
SUMMARY,
Situation update:,
•,A total of 581 confirmed cases have been reported for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) globally;
•,"Of the 581 cases reported, 571 cases were reported from China;"
•,"Cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Taipei"
,"Municipality, China, Macau Special Administrative Region, United States of America and the"
,Republic of Korea; All had travel history to Wuhan;
•,"Of the 571 confirmed cases in China, 375 cases were confirmed from Hubei Province;"
•,"Of the 571 cases, 95 cases are severely ill2 ;"
•,Seventeen deaths have been reported (all from Hubei Province);
"On 23 January2020, the number of reported confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV has increased by 267",
"cases since the last situation report published on 22 January 2020. As of 23 January, China reported",
cases in 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). Twenty five percent of confirmed,
cases reported by China have been classified by Chinese health authorities as seriously ill (from,
"Wubei Province: (16% severely ill, 5% critically ill, and 4% having died).",
"Currently, cases infected in China have been exported to the US, Thailand, Japan and Republic of",
"Korea. It is expected that more cases will be exported to other countries, and that further",
transmission may occur.,
"The initial source of 2019-nCoV still remains unknown. However, it is clear the growing outbreak is",
no longer due to ongoing exposures at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; as in the last one,
"week, less than 15% of new cases reported having visited Huanan market. There is now more",
evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads from human- to- human and also across generations of,
"cases. Moreover, family clusters involving persons with no reported travel to Wuhan have been",
1The situation report includes information reported to WHO Geneva by 10 AM CET,
2Severe illness: According to any of the following criteria:,
(1) dyspnea; (2) respiratory rate more than 30 bpm; (3) hypoxemia; (4) chest X-ray with multi-lobar infiltrates or pulmonary,
infiltration progressed more than 50% within 24 - 48 hours.,

reported from Guangdong Province. There have been very few reports of hospital outbreaks or,
"infections of health care workers, which is a prominent feature of MERS and SARS.",
"WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the",
global level.3,

,summarized the risk for global level to be moderate.

II. PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE:,
WHO:,

,Thai authorities since the reporting of these cases. The three countries have shared
,information with WHO under the International Health Regulations. WHO is also informing
,other countries about the situation and providing support as requested;
•,"On 2 January, the incident management system was activated across the three levels of"
,"WHO (country office, regional office and headquarters);"
•,Developed the surveillance case definitions for human infection with 2019-nCoV and is
,updating it as per the new information becomes available;
•,"Developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection"
,"prevention and control in health care settings, home care for mild patients, risk"
,communication and community engagement;
•,Prepared disease commodity package for supplies necessary in identification and
,management of confirmed patients;
•,Provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans;
•,Updated the travel advice for international travel in health in relation to the outbreak of
,pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus in China;
•,"Utilizing global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and"
,"control, clinical management and mathematical modelling;"
•,"Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics;"
•,WHO is working with our networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global
,"work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and"
,"other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued"
,"interim guidance for countries, updated to take into account the current situation."

IV. Statistical Modelling,
WHO is working with a number of mathematical model groups to better understand the,
epidemiology and transmission dynamics of this event.,
•,"Phylogenetic analysis suggests based on 23 full genome sequences submitted to GISAID, that"
,"the sequences exhibit little genetic variation, which is indicative of a recent origin of the"
,sampled and sequenced viruses. The sequenced genomes show no evidence of additional
,"introductions of the virus from a non-human animal reservoir, although the numbers of"
,"sequences are limited at present. (Andrew Rambaut, University of Edinburgh, UK)"
•,Updated estimated number of cases in Wuhan based on baseline assumptions and
,alternative scenarios: a total of 4000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range:
,"1,000 – 9,700) had onset of symptoms by 18 th January 2020 (Imai et al,"
,https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-
,coronavirus/)
•,"The median size of the Wuhan outbreak is estimated to be 4, 050 infections (95% CI: 1.700-"
,"7, 950) by using an estimate of 10 days from exposure to detection and an effective"
,population of 20 million people in Wuhan catchment as of January 20 (Matteo Chinazzi et al
