TECHNICAL FOCUS
"Figure 2: Epidemic curve by date of onset of 2019-nCoV cases identified outside of China, 27 January 2020"
"Among the 37 cases identified outside of China, three were detected without the onset of symptoms, while among"
"the remaining 34 patients, there is information on date of symptom for 28 individuals. The epidemic curve for these"
individuals is shown in Figure 2.
"The median age of cases detected outside of China is 45 years ranging from2 to 74 years, 71% of cases were male"
"(information was missing on age for 6 cases, and on sex for 4 cases). Of the 27 cases for whom we have detailed"
"information on date of symptom onset and travel date from China, 8 cases had symptom onset in China, 5 had onset"
"on the same day as travel, and 14 developed symptoms after leaving China."
"36 cases had travel history to China, of whom 34 had travel history in Wuhan city, or had an epidemiological link to a"
"confirmed case with travel history to Wuhan. For the remaining two, investigations into their travel histories are"
ongoing. One additional case was the result of human-to-human transmission among close family contacts in Viet
Nam.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,,
•,"Limit human to human transmission including, reducing secondary infections among close contacts and",
,"health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international",
,spread from China*;,
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;",
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;,
•,"Address crucial unknowns and about clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment",
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;",
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;,
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.,
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",,
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",,
"healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness raising in the population, risk",,
communication.,,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also,
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"Developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention and control in"
,"health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus , risk communication and"
,community engagement.
•,Prepared disease commodity package for supplies necessary in identification and management of confirmed
,patients.
•,Provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO is providing guidance on early investigations. The first protocol that is available is a: Household
,transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.
•,"WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including"
,novel coronaviruses.
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new"
,virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and
,"case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand"
,"spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for"
,"implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that"
,is available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
,infection.
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the"
,"disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into"
,account the current situation.
•,"Utilizing global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, clinical"
,management and mathematical modelling.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE,
,During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
,"Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), human to human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and"
,"fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce"
,the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:
•,Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
•,"Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment."
•,Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
•,"People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover"
,"coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands)."
•,"Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in"
,emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory,
"illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel",
history with their health care provider. Travel guidance was updated on 24 January.,
