"1An error in the wording of the situation reports dated 23, 24 and 25 January was corrected on 26 January. Those reports did not correctly reflect the WHO risk assessment. The
risk assessment used to inform our actions, our advice to countries, and to brief Emergency Committee members, evaluates the risk as follows: very high in China, high in the
region and high globally. (The situation reports on the above dates incorrectly reported it as moderate at the global level. They have been corrected.)",,,

TECHNICAL FOCUS: Clinical Management:
"Patients with 2019-nCoV infection, are presenting with a wide range of symptoms. Most seem to have mild disease,"
"and about 20% appear to progress to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases"
death.
"Clinical care of suspected patients with 2019-nCoV should focus on early recognition, immediate isolation"
"(separation), implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and provision of"
"optimized supportive care. WHO is convening a bi-weekly call with clinical experts around the globe, to better"
"understand, in real-time, the clinical presentation and treatment interventions."
"WHO has published interim clinical care guidance for hospitalized patients and for mildly ill patients at home, and"
developed a standardized clinical case record form (CRF) that will be available the website. To facilitate the
"aggregation of standardized clinical data, WHO is launching a Global 2019-nCoV Clinical Data Platform to allow"
Member States to contribute anonymized clinical data in order to inform the public health clinical response. As there
"is currently no known effective antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV, the WHO R&D blueprint is conducting a systematic"
review to evaluate potential therapeutics and develop master clinical protocols that are necessary to accelerate this
globally.
"WHO has also updated the Disease Commodity Package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
"In addition, a notification was sent out to the Emergency Medical Teams network requesting an expression of"
"interest for clinical operations support teams to support triage, referral systems, clinical care and IPC."

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
,"health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international"
,spread from China*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness- raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also,
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention and"
,"control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus , risk communication"
,and community engagement.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,"WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including"
,novel coronaviruses.
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new"
,virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and
,"case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand"
,"spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for"
,"implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that"
,is available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
,infection.
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the"
,"disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, updated to take into"
,account the current situation.
•,"WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,"
,clinical management and mathematical modelling.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE,
,During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
,"Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and"
,"fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce"
,the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:
•,Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
•,"Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment."
•,Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
•,"People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover"
,"coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands)."
•,"Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in"
,emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory,
"illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history",
with their healthcare provider. Travel guidance was updated on 24 January.,
