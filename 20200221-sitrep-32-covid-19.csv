SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Food related considerations,,,,,,,,,
"The new COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats,",,,,,,,,,
but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This,,,,,,,,,
"intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has",,,,,,,,,
not yet been identified.,,,,,,,,,
"WHO continues to collaborate with experts, Member States and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities",,,,,,,,,
"for the control of COVID-19, and provide advice to countries and individuals on prevention measures. National food",,,,,,,,,
safety authorities have been following this event with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN),,,,,,,,,
Secretariat to seek more information on the potential for persistence of the virus on foods traded internationally and,,,,,,,,,
the potential role of food in the transmission of the virus. Experiences from previous outbreaks of related,,,,,,,,,
"coronaviruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory",,,,,,,,,
"syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) show that transmission through food consumption did not occur. To date, there",,,,,,,,,
"have not been any reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. However, concerns were expressed",,,,,,,,,
about the potential for these viruses to persist on raw foods of animal origin.,,,,,,,,,
"Currently, there are investigations conducted to evaluate the viability and survival time of SARS-CoV-2. In general,",,,,,,,,,
"coronaviruses are very stable in a frozen state according to studies of other coronaviruses, which have shown survival",,,,,,,,,
for up to two years at -20°C. Studies conducted on SARS-CoV ad MERS-CoV indicate that these viruses can persist on,,,,,,,,,
"different surfaces for up to a few days depending on a combination of parameters such as temperature, humidity and",,,,,,,,,
"light. For example, at refrigeration temperature (4°C), MERS-CoV can remain viable for up to 72 hours. Current",,,,,,,,,
evidence on other coronavirus strains shows that while coronaviruses appear to be stable at low and freezing,,,,,,,,,
"temperatures for a certain period, food hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through",,,,,,,,,
"food. Specifically, coronaviruses are thermolabile, which means that they are susceptible to normal cooking",,,,,,,,,
"temperatures (70°C). Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be",,,,,,,,,
"avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with",,,,,,,,,
uncooked foods.,,,,,,,,,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are susceptible to the most common cleaning and disinfection protocols and there is no,,,,,,,,,
indication so far that SARS-Cov-2 behaves differently.,,,,,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
,"health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international"
,spread from China*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage."
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact
,investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an
,"early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-"
,"19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health"
,guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,"WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
,"viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish); Critical Care of Severe Acute"
,Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new"
,virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case
,"definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,"

,"severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of"
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:"
,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the"
,"disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated"
,regularly.
•,"WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,"
,clinical management and mathematical modelling.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe,
"Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and",
"fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the",
general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:,
•,Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
•,"Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment."
•,Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
•,"People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover"
,"coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands)."
•,"Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially"
,in emergency departments.
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory,
"illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history",
with their health care provider.,
