STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and
,"health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international"
,spread from China*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage."
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact
,investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to gain an
,"early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-"
,"19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health"
,guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,"WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
,"viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, and Spanish); Critical Care of Severe Acute"
,Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new"
,virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case

,"definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,"
,"severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of"
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:"
,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the"
,"disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated"
,regularly.
•,"WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,"
,clinical management and mathematical modelling.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
"If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have",
"not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.",
"However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the",
facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See Frequently Asked,
"Questions) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential",
sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the,
situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See Protection measures for,
everyone).,
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow,
the advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild,
"illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-",
"existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.",
(See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is,
spreading).,
