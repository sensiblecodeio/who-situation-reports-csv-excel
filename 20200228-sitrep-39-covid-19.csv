SUBJECT IN FOCUS: UPDATE ON ADDITIONAL HEALTH MEASURES,,,,,
"As of 27 February 2020, 41 States Parties have provided to WHO official reports on additional health measures that",,,,,
"significantly interfere with international traffic under Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005), of",,,,,
which 14 are small island developing states. Seven States Parties provided updates on the measures they have,,,,,
previously reported on. Eleven of the 41 States Parties are now reporting such measures against countries other,,,,,
than China. No trade restrictions have been reported to date. Table 1 presents a summary of additional health,,,,,
"measures officially reported to WHO under Article 43 from 6 – 28 February, by WHO region.",,,,,

The majority of these measures are related to denial of entry of travelers originating from China or from countries,,,,,
"reporting on-going transmission of COVID-19, quarantine requirements for foreigners, self-isolation of returning",,,,,
"nationals, and visa restrictions. The public health rationale for these additional health measures is mainly linked to",,,,,
"vulnerabilities (e.g. lack of capacity for diagnostic and response, small island states context) in receiving countries,",,,,,
and the uncertainties about the virus transmission and disease severity.,,,,,
Preliminary analysis of countries reporting cases that have imposed restrictive measures suggest that such measures,,,,,
"may have delayed the importation of new cases, but did not prevent the importation of the disease. WHO has",,,,,
"emphasized to Member States that additional measures should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in",,,,,
"duration, and reconsidered in light of the evolution of the outbreak and the constant advancements of knowledge",,,,,
about the virus and the disease.,,,,,
"WHO has published updated advice for international traffic, and continues to recommend against the application of",,,,,
any travel or trade restrictions in relation to the current COVID-19 outbreak.,,,,,
WHO continues to engage with travel and tourism international organizations and industry associations to enable,,,,,
compliance with the IHR on avoidance of unnecessary interference with international traffic. Joint statements have,,,,,
"been issued by WHO in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and UN World Tourism",,,,,
"Organization (UNWTO), and will shortly be issues in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization",,,,,
(ICAO).,,,,,

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,
† Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become,,,,
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is,,,,
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within,,,,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",,,,
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,,,,
Terms:,,,,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by",,,
,increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.,,,
-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.,,,
-,Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.,,,
-,Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.,,,
-,Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined),,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage."
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the"
,"disease and interrupt onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated"
,regularly.
•,"WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control,"
,clinical management and mathematical modelling.
•,"WHO has prepared disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
"viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in French, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese); Critical Care of",
Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT,

,(available in French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19); Critical Care Severe
•,"Acute Respiratory Infection
WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,
severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations"
,One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of"
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health"
,guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
"If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have",
"not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of being infected are low. It is",
understandable that you may feel stressed and anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from,
reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See,
"Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health",
authority and your employer on accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you,
live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your,
family (see Protection measures for everyone).,
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow,
the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID-19,
"infected will cause mild illness, it can make some people very ill and in some people it can be fatal. Older people, and",
"those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes)",
appear to be at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,
