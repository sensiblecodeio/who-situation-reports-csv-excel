SUBJECT IN FOCUS: INFODEMICS
"Infodemics are an excessive amount of information about a problem, which makes it difficult to identify a solution."
"Infodemics can spread misinformation, disinformation and rumors during a health emergency. Infodemics can"
"hamper an effective public health response and create confusion and distrust among people. To manage infodemics,"
WHO has developed an innovative communication initiative called the WHO Network for Information in Epidemics
(EPI-WIN).
"During emergencies demand for information is high, there are often many unknowns and people will seek"
"information from sources and individuals and entities they trust. WHO, through EPI-WIN, has identified such trusted"
"sources and engaged them not only as amplifiers of accurate, timely information, but also as advisers on the kind of"
information that their constituents need and urgently want to see.
Information exchange takes place through regular engagement calls with these “trust chains”. EPI-WIN leverages all
communications platforms available to it and partners with these trusted channels to amplify evidence-based
"information tailored to different audiences, answering pertinent questions as the event unfolds and linking them to"
additional response assets.
A “trust chain” with employers and employees – the world of work
Such a “trust chain” has been established around the world of work. Workers spend approximately one-third of their
"adult lives at work. Because of this, employers and businesses can serve as amplifiers of trusted information about"
"COVID-19 for employees. Employers in both private and public sector are asking how to protect their staff,"
contractors and customers from COVID-19. Employees associations and trade unions are also seeking information
"on how WHO policies, guidance and recommendations can be implemented in their workplace settings."
"Working with the World Economic Forum, EPI-WIN has established networks with the key business sectors and"
public enterprises likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and future epidemics. These have been grouped into networks
"of Healthcare & Health Workers, Travel & Tourism, Food & Agriculture and International Mass Gatherings. Within"
"each network, there are multi-national enterprises, professional associations and UN specialized bodies representing"
sectors that employ tens of millions of people and account for many billions of dollars in economic activity.
EPI-WIN is also working with WHO’s Department of Occupational Safety and Health and their counterpart; global
trade unions through the International Labor Organization (ILO)’s Bureau of Workers Activities (ACTRAV) and the
International Trade Union Council (ITUC) which brings together affiliated trade union bodies that represent 210
million workers in 163 countries.

The engagement with trade unions has allowed many concerns to be raised around issues that could impact upon
the effectiveness of public health policies and interventions aimed at containing the COVID-19 epidemic. These
"include issues such as infection prevention and rights of public-facing workers in health, social care and retail"
sectors; safe staffing levels when sickness absences may lead to fewer workers facing potentially unsafe increases in
"workload; income protection for those isolated, self-isolating or requiring time off work because of school/transport"
closures; and discussions with employers on remote working and flexible working patterns. EPI-WIN also works
closely with the WHO Health Workforce Department that collaborates with approximately 80 global healthworker
associations.
"This is just one example of a “trust chain”. Others have been developed around healthcare workers, travel and"
"tourism, faith-based organizations, large event organisers and others. Please visit the EPI-WIN website for more"
information and to view advice.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage."
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection"
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are"
,updated regularly.
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
"viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and",
Russian); Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory,
diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus,
(COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in,

,English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support,
,country preparedness and response.,
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here:",
,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations,
,One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
"If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is",,
"spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
,A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,"
,,"cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a"
,,history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation
,,report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR,,
,B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-
,,19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;
OR,,
,C.,A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease

"(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains"
the clinical presentation.
Probable case
A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.
• Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory
Confirmed case
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms."
