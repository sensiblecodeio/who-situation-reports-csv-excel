SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Q&A: Similarities and differences – COVID-19 and influenza
"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, comparisons have been drawn to influenza. Both cause respiratory"
"disease, yet there are important differences between the two viruses and how they spread. This has important"
implications for the public health measures that can be implemented to respond to each virus.
Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?
"Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory"
"disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death."
"Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health"
"measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and"
"immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection."
Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?
The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter
median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the
time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6
"days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-"
19.
"Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the"
"virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are"
"learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this"
does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.
The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is
"understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both"
"COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult."
"Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data"
indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low.
Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from
"adults, rather than vice versa."
"While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different."
"For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection,"
"requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection"
would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.
"Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying"
"chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that"
older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.
"Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of"
"COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the"
"number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number"
"of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually"
"well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care."
Q. What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?
While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in
"development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19. In contrast,"
"antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is"
highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage."
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection"
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are"
,updated regularly.
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory
"viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and",
Russian); Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections; and Health and safety briefing for respiratory,
diseases - ePROTECT (available in English and French); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus,
(COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); Critical Care Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (available in,
English and French); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support,
country preparedness and response.,
"• WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",

and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,
CASE DEFINITIONS,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
document which includes case definitions.,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",
Suspect case,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,"
,"cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a"
,history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation
,report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-
,19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;
OR,
C.,A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease
,"(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains"
,the clinical presentation.
Probable case,
A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.,
• Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory,
Confirmed case,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",
• Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.,
