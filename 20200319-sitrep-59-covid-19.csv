SUBJECT IN FOCUS: New protocol for Early Epidemiologic investigations for public health,,
response,,
"With the emergence of COVID-19 virus, many uncertainties remain as to certain epidemiological, seroepidemiologi-",,
"cal (related to identifying antibodies in the population), clinical and virological characteristics of the virus and",,
associated disease. Studies to assess these characteristics in different settings are critical to furthering our,,
understanding. They will also provide the robust information needed to refine forecasting models and inform public,,
health measures.,,
"As such, WHO, in collaboration with technical partners, has adapted early epidemiological investigations protocols",,
"from pandemic influenza and from MERS-CoV, to better understand these characteristics and how they may be used",,
to inform public health measures.,,
"To date, five early seroepidemiological core protocols and data collection forms are available on the WHO COVID-19",,
Technical guidance website.,,
"All protocols propose a standardized methodology to allow data and biological samples to be systematically collected,",,
"taking into consideration local setting and outbreak characteristics, and shared rapidly in a format that can be easily",,
"aggregated, tabulated and analyzed across many different settings globally.",,
Study Protocol,Objectives,
The First Few COVID-19,To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the:,
cases and contacts,•,clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease
transmission investigation,•,secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19
protocol (FFX),,"infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age"
,,"and sex, for various end-points)"
,•,serial interval of COVID-19 infection
,•,symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and
,,laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission
Households transmission,•,To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating
of COVID-19 investigation,,"the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and"
protocol,,factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk
,•,"To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk"
,,"factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections"
,•,To characterize serologic response following confirmed COVID-19 infection
Assessment of COVID-19,•,To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health
risk factors among Health,,"care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker"
workers protocol,,contacts at an individual level
,•,To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors
,,for infection among health care workers
,•,To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among
,,health care workers
"Surface sampling of
COVID-19 for health care
professionals","•
•","To assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19
virus
To identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission
of COVID-19 infection"
Population based,•,To estimate age-specific seroprevalence
serologic survey,,
"The latest protocol, the Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19",,
"virus infection, is intended to provide key epidemiological and serologic characteristics of COVID-19 virus in the",,
"general population. Specifically, data from this protocol will provide critical information about the extent of infection",,
"(as measured by the presence of antibodies in study subjects) in the general population, age-specific infection",,

"cumulative incidence, and the fraction of people with asymptomatic or subclinical infection.",
"The results of these investigations, whether individually or pooled across study sites/countries, will allow further",
"understanding and provide robust estimates of key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the",
"COVID-19 virus, including:",
•,"Key epidemiological parameters, such as: secondary infection rate and secondary clinical attack rate of"
,"COVID-19 infection among close contacts, asymptomatic fraction of infection, serial interval and incubation"
,"period of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection"
•,Clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease
•,"Risk factors for transmission and infection, and identification of possible routes of transmission"
•,Impact of infection prevention and control measures in health care settings
•,Serological response following symptomatic COVID-19 infection
•,Age-stratified seroprevalence of antibodies against COVID-19 virus
•,"Cumulative incidence of infection, including extent of age-specific infection"
•,Infection and disease-severity ratios (case-hospitalization ratio [CHR] and case-fatality ratio [CFR])
•,Viral load and shedding profiles
•,Viral persistence on surfaces
"To date, 13 countries across five of the six WHO regions, including both high-income and low-and middle-income",
"countries, have begun to implement at least one of the early investigation protocols. A further 18 countries have",
signaled their intention to implement one of the protocols. WHO will continue to support countries in their,
epidemiological investigations through the provision of clear and comprehensive protocols.,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
"• To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.",
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection"
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are"
,updated regularly.
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,"OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the"
,"response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online"
,"courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel"

,"coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Serbian, and"
,"Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, and"
,"Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,"
,"Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)"
,"(available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and"
,COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness
,and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data"
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to"
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,"
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of"
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One"
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of"
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health"
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,
CASE DEFINITIONS,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
document which includes case definitions.,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",
Suspect case,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g.,"
,"cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a"
,history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation
,report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
OR,

B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-
,19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;
OR,
C.,A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease
,"(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains"
,the clinical presentation.
Probable case,
A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.,
• Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory,
Confirmed case,
