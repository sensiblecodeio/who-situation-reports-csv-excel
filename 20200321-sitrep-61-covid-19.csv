‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become,,,,,

other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,,,,,
Terms:,,,,,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by",,,,

-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
"• To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.",
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,"
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel"
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with"
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection"
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are"
,updated regularly.
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,"OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the"
,"response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online"
,"courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel"
"coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese,",
"Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian,",

,"and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French,"
,"Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)"
,"(available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian);"
,and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country
,preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data"
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to"
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,"
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of"
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One"
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of"
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health"
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,
CASE DEFINITIONS,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
document which includes case definitions.,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",
Suspect case,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,"
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of"
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
,OR
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;
,OR

C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;,
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;,
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal,
,protective equipment1; OR,
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.,
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",,
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,,
