SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Public Health and Social Measures for the COVID-19 Pandemic
The purpose of this note is to outline public health and social measures useful for slowing or stopping the spread of
"COVID-19 at national or community level. Guidance for case finding and management, personal and environmental"
"measures, travel measures, and mass gatherings is available on the WHO website available here."
"Public health and social measures are measures or actions by individuals, institutions, communities, local and"
national governments and international bodies to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures to reduce
"transmission of COVID-19 include individual and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact-"
"tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings, international travel"
"measures, and vaccines and treatments. While vaccines and specific medications are not yet available for COVID-19,"
other public health and social measures play an essential role in reducing the number of infections and saving lives.
Social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease by stopping chains of transmission of
COVID-19 and preventing new ones from appearing. These measures secure physical distance between people (of at
"least one metre), and reduce contact with contaminated surfaces, while encouraging and sustaining virtual social"
connection within families and communities. Measures for the general public include introducing flexible work
"arrangements such as teleworking, distance learning, reducing and avoiding crowding, closure of non-essential"
"facilities and services, shielding and protection for vulnerable groups, local or national movement restrictions and"
"staying-at home measures, and coordinated reorganization of health care and social services networks to protect"
hospitals. The measures are used in conjunction with individual protective measures against COVID-19 such as
frequent hand washing and cough etiquette.
All public health measures to stop disease spread can be balanced with adaptive strategies to encourage community
"resilience and social connection, protect incomes and secure the food supply. Countries should balance the possible"
benefits and negative consequences of each intervention and deploy strategies to encourage community
"engagement, gain trust and limit social or economic harm. There are many strategies that can support community"
"resilience and mental health, protect access to essential goods and services, and limit the economic impact of stay-"
"at-home measures where these are deemed necessary. For example, organizing work-sites to ensure physical"
"distance between persons, such as staggering shifts over time, or converting on-site service to home delivery may"
help to keep more businesses open. Tele-working and tele-schooling strategies in different contexts demonstrate
innovation and the role of technology in supporting business continuity and sustaining social connection within
"families and communities. In general, implementation of distancing measures should also aim to sustain personal"
"and professional community connections by virtual means and technology, including widely accessible means such"
as radio and mobile phones.
"Alongside all these measures remains there is the critical to test all suspected cases of COVID-19 wherever possible,"
"promptly isolate cases, trace contacts to the widest extent possible, and ensure quarantine of contacts for the"
"duration of the incubation period. This goes for any context or level of spread of the pandemic in a country, in order"
to deepen the benefits of social measures. Social measures should make the task of contact tracing much easier as
the number of contacts rapidly dwindles and eventually the number of cases declines as well. As social measures are
"lifted, it is essential to continue to strengthen case-finding, isolation for COVID-19 cases and quarantine of contacts,"
in order to respond to resurgent or imported cases. Coordinated reorganization of health and social services is
"essential to assess and test persons rapidly, treat patients effectively, and protect hospitals and health personnel."
WHO has described four levels of COVID-19 transmission. These are countries or local areas with: 1. No cases
"reported. 2. Sporadic cases. 3. Clusters of cases (grouped in place and time), or 4. Community transmission."
Countries are putting in place a range of public health and social measures in different combinations and at varying
times in the local evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alignment of public health measures to levels of
transmission in a community is not fixed in stone. Countries may wish to specify which measures are to be taken at
"each level and review the situation regularly. A package of measures may be applied at local, regional or national"
"level and adjusted as needed, considering aspects such as culture, living environments, terrain and access to needed"
resources. Essential services should remain operational and governments should put in place social and economic
"policies to limit the longer term economic impact, support community resilience and enable rapid recovery. Most"
"importantly, the ultimate aim is to ‘walk back’ community transmission to clusters, sporadic cases, and down to no"
"cases at all, and to begin gradually lifting social measures as soon as it is safe to do so. Guidance for lifting measures"

is being developed.
"To be effective, public health measures must be implemented with the full engagement of all members of society,"
"including communities and professional groups. All measures should be accompanied with clear, accessible and"
regular risk communication to explain the response strategy and enable people to make informed decisions to
protect themselves and help achieve the public health goal of ending the outbreak.
A table summarizing public health and social measures to support control of COVID-19 will be available shortly at

‡ Caseclassifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,
§ Transmissionclassification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become,
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is,
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,
Terms:,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by"
,increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
-,Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
-,Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
-,Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)
"** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status",

"Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always",
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed,
"COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different",
data cutoff times are to be expected.,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
