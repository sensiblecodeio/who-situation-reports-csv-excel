SUBJECT IN FOCUS: The routes of transmission from COVID-19 patients,
"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, we are learning more about this new virus every day. Here we",
"summarize what has been reported about transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and provide a brief overview of available",
"evidence on transmission from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with COVID-19.",
Symptomatic transmission,
"By way of definition, a symptomatic COVID-19 case is a case who has developed signs and symptoms compatible with",
COVID-19 virus infection. Symptomatic transmission refers to transmission from a person while they are experiencing,
symptoms.,
Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from,
"symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected",
"persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. 1-7 This is supported by detailed experiences shared by",
"technical partners via WHO global expert networks, and reports and presentations by Ministries of Health.",
Data from clinical and virologic studies that have collected repeated biological samples from confirmed patients,
provide evidence that shedding of the COVID-19 virus is highest in upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) early in,
"the course of the disease. 8-11 That is, within the first 3 days from onset of symptoms. 10-11 Preliminary data suggests",
that people may be more contagious around the time of symptom onset as compared to later on in the disease.,
Pre-symptomatic transmission,
"The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and",
"symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days. During this period, also known as the “pre-",
"symptomatic” period, some infected persons can be contagious. Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case",
can occur before symptom onset.,
"In a small number of case reports and studies, pre-symptomatic transmission has been documented through contact",
tracing efforts and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases. 12-17 This is supported by data suggesting that,
"some people can test positive for COVID-19 from 1-3 days before they develop symptoms. 6,16 Thus, it is possible that",
people infected with COVID-19 could transmit the virus before significant symptoms develop. It is important to,
recognize that pre-symptomatic transmission still requires the virus to be spread via infectious droplets or through,
touching contaminated surfaces.,
Asymptomatic transmission,
An asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms.,
"Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms.",
"There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no",
documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases,
have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries.,
WHO regularly monitors all emerging evidence about this critical topic and will provide an update as more information,
becomes available.,

‡ Caseclassifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available officialdata and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become,
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is,
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted t hat even within,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,
Terms:,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by"
,increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established labora tories).
-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
-,Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
-,Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
-,Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)
"** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).,
"Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always",
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed,
"COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID -19 data using different inclusion criteria and different",
data cutoff times are to be expected.,
Erratum: Deaths for Syrian Arab Republic has been revised. Cases and new cases for Kuwait have been revised.,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID -19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
,protective equipment 1 ; OR
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.",
