SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Online interactive courses for Points of entry
"WHO continues to provide technical guidance in the context of COVID-19 for ports, airports and ground crossings,"
including for conveyances. This week two online interactive courses have been published on the WHO COVID-19
website. These are based on guidance documents already published that were developed with input from the
"International Maritime Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Air Transport"
Association as well as major industry associations.
The interactive courses highlight important information reinforce learning through active recall - by engaging
learners to answer short quizzes and respond to different scenarios in a safe learning environment.
Online course for the management of ill travellers at point of entry
This interactive e-learning course is based on the WHO Interim Guidance for Management of ill travellers at Points of
"Entry – international airports, seaports and ground crossings – in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. This course"
"is intended for National IHR Focal Points, public health authorities and operators at points of entry, conveyance"
"operators, and other stakeholders."

Online course for operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreaks on board ships
This course has been developed using the WHO Interim Guidance for Operational considerations for managing
"COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board ships. It is intended for any authority involved in public health response to a
COVID-19 public health event on board ships, including IHR National Focal Points (NFP), port health authorities, local,
provincial and national health surveillance and response systems, as well as port operators and ship operators."

"the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its",,,,,,,

frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on ma ps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.,
‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become,
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is,
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted t hat even within,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,
Terms:,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by"
,increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established labora tories).
-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
-,Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
-,Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
-,Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)
"** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99).,
"Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always",
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed,
"COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID -19 data using different inclusion criteria and different",
data cutoff times are to be expected.,
New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.,
Erratum: Number of cases and deaths have been revised for Republic of Moldova. Transmission classification has been revised for Bhutan.,
Number of ‘total deaths’ and ‘new deaths’ have been revised for Oman. New cases has been revised for Kuwait.,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID -19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
