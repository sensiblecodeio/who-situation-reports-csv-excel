SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Supporting countries with COVID-19 supplies and logistical needs
Improving supply networks
Significant efforts are underway to improve access to items essential for the COVID-19 emergency response.
"Through the continued efforts of WHO and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), the personal protective"
"equipment (PPE) manufacturing market is beginning to open, however demand continues to outstrip available"
supply.
The Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) unit at WHO is working to convene meetings with key stakeholders
"including oxygen, ventilator and concentrator manufacturers and producers of associated ancillary equipment. In"
"addition to securing the appropriate equipment for those countries at most risk or most vulnerable, WHO and the"
"PSCN is working with the World Bank and other UN agencies to ensure that the infrastructure, technical guidance"
and other operational guidance is available.
"Through collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), OSL’s COVID -19 Essential Supplies Forecasting"
Tool has been finalized. Output from the model is being shared with partners and is assisting both procurement
agencies and suppliers in understanding national requirements of key supplies.
Sending personal protective equipment and testing kits
"Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 900 000 surgical masks, 62 000 N95 masks, 1 million"
"gloves, 115 000 gowns, 17 000 goggles and 34 000 face shields to 133 countries. OSL has also shipped COVID-19"
testing kits to 126 countries.
Strengthening health logistics in clinical environments
"OSL has also launched and supported the COVID-19 Health Logistics Project, establishing direct technical support to"
hospitals to re-design their facilities into infectious disease treatment units. This support has included improving
"patient and healthcare worker flow, promoting rational use of PPE, and minimizing nosocomial transmission."
"To achieve these aims, OSL has established the Health Logistics Technical Network (HLTN). The network is composed"
"of recognized universities, humanitarian institutions and international NGOs focused on technical interventions. A"
"WHO-based helpdesk serves as a centralized resource to answer technical questions, verify and provide inputs on"
"COVID-19 facility layouts, troubleshoot problems, and facilitate solutions to problems while supporting experts in the"
"field. Helpdesk support has been successfully provided in Australia for the Canberra Hospital Campus SARI layout,"
and additional support has been requested from Italy and France.

‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become,,,,,,

evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted t hat even within,,,,,,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have di ffering degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",,,,,,
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,,,,,,
Terms:,,,,,,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by",,,,,

-,Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.,,,,,
-,Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19,
