SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Partner Coordination,
Global Health Cluster,
•,"The Global Health Cluster, which WHO leads, has been supporting 29 countries to implement the Global"
,Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19. This includes addressing newly-emerging needs and preserving the
,existing humanitarian health actions and commitments of the Humanitarian Response Plans for 2020.
•,"In collaboration with the Gender-Based Violence Area of Responsibility (GBV AoR), a webinar was held on"
,“Ensuring continuity of essential health services for survivors of GBV during COVID-19”. The GBV AoR is the
,global level forum for coordination and collaboration on GBV prevention and response in humanitarian settings.
Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) Initiative,
•,Over 100 Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) and focal points worldwide are working closely with the EMT
,"Secretariat, and are continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international"
,COVID-19 response operations.
•,"As of 5 April, five international EMTs have been deployed to eight countries. Twenty-nine EMTs are supporting"
,and reinforcing local national health systems across all regions. EMTs are also involved in discussions to strengthen
,"capacity and support to countries in Africa. In addition, WHO is working with EMTs worldwide to identify technical"
,experts and coordinators who can support integrated public health and clinical teams.
•,"WHO has finalised technical guidance on COVID-19 community facilities and treatment centers, pre-hospital"
,"emergency medical services recommendations, and recommendations for medical surge capacity and"
,deployments of EMTs. A modular training package on COVID-19 is currently being developed for the EMT
,workforce.
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) deployments and partnership activities,
•,WHO has deployed 59 experts from 27 partner institutions and technical networks to support countries. Twenty-
,two partners of the GOARN Capacity Development Network are meeting this week to strengthen coordination of
,training and capacity building activities.
•,"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF, and WHO are supporting"
,"Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE) with a special focus on highly vulnerable populations,"
,and integration of humanitarian partners to support social distancing solutions amongst migrants and in camp
,"settings. This week’s focus is mask guidance among the general population, and in the event of easing of"
,"movement restrictions. The partnership is also looking at social science and community insights, including"
,"perception surveys and community engagement during lockdowns, to explore guidance, operational challenges"
,and lessons learnt from ongoing experience.
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) research activities,
GOARN research activities include:,
•,Creating a repository of RCCE data collection tools to aid researchers and public health organizations to roll out
,"rapid assessments in their communities of interest. If you would like to contribute, please contact Dr. Jeni Stolow"
,at jstolow@tulane.edu.
•,"Coordination with Field Epidemiology Training Programmes, regional and global networks, and alumni networks,"
,on exchange of protocols and tools for investigations and response.
•,Coordination of global partners to support the WHO COVID-19 Research Innovation and Research Roadmap
,Social Science Working Group. Ongoing research includes psychosocial impact of community-based
,"interventions, psychosocial assessment of healthcare workers (HCWs), HCW readiness for COVID-19 infection"
,"prevention and control, home-based care delivery, and decision-making for palliative care."

•,"Knowledge management of COVID-19-related information, including identification of research findings and"
,channeling of findings to appropriate audiences; and development of a process for rapid literature
,"searches/reviews. For information on the above activities, please contact Dr. Lina Moses at"
,lmoses2@tulane.edu.
Critical Supply Chains and Goods,
•,UNICEF is leading joint UN efforts to access substantial quantities of critical items such as PPE and supplies for
,"intensive care, through a joint tender where the overall allocation principles of supplies will be guided by WHO"
,and the Supply Chain Inter-Agency Coordination Cell. The detailed process is under development.

‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become,,,,,,,

evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within,,,,,,,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",,,,,,,
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,,,,,,,
Terms:,,,,,,,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by",,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.",
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and",
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,",
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel",
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with",
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).,
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a,
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The",
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.,
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also,
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.,
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,",
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection",
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are",
,updated regularly.,
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,",
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.,
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.,
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel,
,coronavirus 2019-nCoV.,
•,"WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.",
•,"OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the",
,response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national,
,"languages here. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:",
,o,"A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in"
,,"Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese,"
,,Serbian and Turkish);
,o,"Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian"
,,and Vietnamese);

,,"Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and"
,o,COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country
,,preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
