SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Having faith during COVID-19,
A sad reality of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many people have been infected in settings where they turn to for,
comfort at these difficult times. There have been outbreaks of COVID-19 among religious communities due to certain,
"religious practices. To help stop transmission in communities while allowing people options to worship, WHO’s",
Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) brings together members of diverse faith-based communities in virtual,
meetings and discussions. The EPI-WIN team and faith experts discuss the critical role of religious leaders and faith-,
based communities in saving lives and reducing illness during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.,
Faith-based communities play a substantial role in supporting local health systems; advocating for the rights of,
vulnerable populations; providing support and comfort to communities; and being a trusted source of information.,
"They are often integrated into broader communities through the services they provide, and in doing so they reach",
the most vulnerable groups with assistance and health information.,
"The EPI-WIN team and the faith community have co-developed practical guidance and recommendations, available",
"here, to support the special role of religious leaders, faith-based organizations, and faith-based communities in",
"COVID-19 education, preparedness, and response. This includes:",
•,"Sharing evidence-based information about COVID-19, preparedness, and response"
•,"Avoiding large group gatherings and conducting rituals and faith-related activities remotely/virtually, as required"
,and whenever possible
•,"Ensuring that any decision to convene group gatherings for worship, education, or social meetings is based on a"
,sound risk assessment and in line with guidance from national and local authorities
•,"Ensuring safe faith-based gatherings, ceremonies, and rituals when they do occur"
•,"Strengthening mental and spiritual health, well-being and resilience, through individual contact (while observing"
,appropriate physical distancing) and through social and other communications media
•,"Ensuring a human-rights-based approach to advocacy, messaging and service delivery"
•,"Addressing stigma, violence, and the incitement of hate"
•,"Promoting ecumenical and interfaith collaboration, and peaceful coexistence during the COVID-19 pandemic"
•,Ensuring that accurate information is shared with communities; and misinformation in addressed.
"EPI-WIN have also developed a mass gatherings risk assessment tool available here, and a decision tree available",

‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may,,,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,

,,preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
