SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Infection in health care workers
"Healthcare workers (HCWs) play an essential role at the front lines, providing care for patients. In the context of"
"COVID-19 and during routine health services, they provide critical care to patients and ensure that infection"
prevention and control (IPC) measures are implemented and adhered to in healthcare facilities in order to limit
healthcare-associated infections.
"As of 8 April 2020, 22 073 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. However,"
"at the present time, there is no systematic reporting of HCW COVID-19 infections to WHO and therefore this number"
probably under-represents the true number of COVID-19 HCW infections globally.
"To date, there are a limited number of publications and national situation reports that provide information on the"
"number of HCW infections. For example, a publication from China CDC on 44 672 confirmed cases as of 17 February"
"2020 indicated 1688 (3.8%) infections were among HCWs, including five deaths.1 In Italy, a situation report from 10"
"April 2020 reported 15 314 infections among HCW, representing 11% of all infections at that time. 2 Further"
publications have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infections among HCWs.3-7 While many
"infections are indicated as mild, severe outcomes, including deaths, among HCWs have also been reported."
Understanding infection in HCWs is critical to informing the specific IPC measures needed to protect HCWs from
infection. A limited number of publications have identified risk factors for infection among HCWs. Preliminary results
"suggest HCWs are being infected both in the workplace and in the community, most often through infected family"
"members. 8 In healthcare settings, factors associated with HCW infection have included: late recognition or suspicion"
"of COVID-19 in patients, working in a higher-risk department, longer duty hours, sub-optimal adherence to IPC"
"measures such as hand hygiene practices, and lack of or improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). 9-10"
"Other factors have also been documented, such as inadequate or insufficient IPC training for respiratory pathogens,"
"including the COVID-19 virus, as well as long exposure in areas in healthcare facilities where large numbers of COVID-"
19 patients were being cared for.
"To prevent infection in healthcare settings, WHO recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions by HCWs"
caring for patients with COVID-19.11 WHO also recommends that airborne precautions be applied in settings in which
"procedures and support treatments that generate aerosols are performed. 11 In this context, the correct use of PPE is"
"critical, in particular wearing appropriate PPE for the clinical setting, paying special attention to procedures to put on"
"and remove PPE correctly, and adhering to hand hygiene and other IPC measures. When these precautions are"
"applied correctly and consistently, alongside standard precautions and administrative, engineering and"
"environmental controls, the risk for HCW infections is substantially reduced or avoided altogether."
WHO has also developed a risk assessment tool for exposed HCWs in a healthcare facility 12 and a sero-
"epidemiological protocol to determine risk factors for infection among HCW, 13 and is finalizing an in- depth"
epidemiological surveillance tool for HCW infections. A number of countries are currently using these tools and
"protocols, and this information will be essential to understand the extent of infection among HCWs, the extent of"
transmission within healthcare facilities and the best approaches to protect HCWs against infection.
"Finally, as HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19 are subject to long working hours, fatigue, occupational burn-out,"
"stigma, physical and psychological violence, and back injury from patient handling, it is important that efforts be"
"made to maintain the physical and mental health of HCWs and the quality of care. Therefore, WHO recommends"
"that IPC measures be complemented by occupational safety and health measures, psycho-social support, adequate"
"staffing levels, and clinical rotation, to reduce the risk of burn-out, for safe and healthy working environments and to"
respect the rights of health workers to decent working conditions.1

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",

"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",,
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,

Definition of contact,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
,protective equipment1; OR
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,
