SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO global case-based surveillance for human infection with
coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
"Following the notification of COVID-19 cases among travelers from Wuhan, China in early January, WHO set up a global"
"surveillance system to gather essential information to monitor the epidemic. Beginning on 26 January, all Members"
States were requested to immediately report confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 to WHO with a minimal set
of information through a standardized case reporting form (CRF).
"As of 13 April, a total of 747 546 confirmed cases were documented via case reporting forms (CRFs) received from 113"
"countries, territories and areas across five different WHO regions and three international conveyances. The number"
of cases with a CRF accounts for 44.0% of the confirmed cases reported globally as of 13 April 10 AM. Distribution per
"region shows that 316 076 (42.3%) of CRFs were reported from the European Region, 415 484 (55.6%) from the Region"
"of the Americas, 10 662 (1.4%) from the Western Pacific Region, 4717 (0.6%) from the Eastern Mediterranean Region,"
"136 (0.02%) from the South-East Asia Region, and none from the Africa Region. An additional 471 CRFs have been"
submitted from international conveyances. It is important to note that of the cases which are documented with CRFs
"so far, the United States of America, Italy and Germany account for 74% of all cases in the database. Thus, these data"
should not be considered representative of all globally confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Distribution by age and sex of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system
globally to date
A total of 716 570 CRFs (95.9%) reported information on age and sex. The sex ratio (male to female) among the
"confirmed cases is 1.03:1, and the median age is 51 (interquartile range, IQR: 36-65) years. For males, the median age"
"is 52 (IQR 37-65) years, and for females 50 (IQR 35-64) years. The sex ratio varies significantly with age in all ranges"
"except 10-19 years. The largest sex ratios (male to female) are observed amongst the 0-9 year (1.16), 60-69 year"
"(1.27:1), and 70-79 year (1.34:1) age groups. Conversely, the lowest sex ratios (i.e. those showing more females than"
males) are found in the 20-29 year (0.85:1) and 80 years and over (0.78:1) age groups (Figure 2). When cases reported
"from the United States, Germany and Italy are excluded, the overall sex ratio changes to 0.95:1 (more females than"
"males amongst the cases), while there remains an excess of males in the 0-9, 60-69 and 70-79 year age groups (data"
not shown).
Figure 2: Distribution by age and sex of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance
system to date.

"Distribution by age of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system over time,"
"from 24 February through 13 April, 2020"
The age distribution has varied with the progression of the epidemic from 24 February (the week in which sufficient
"CRFs began to be reported) to the present. As shown in Figure 3, the proportions of cases aged 0-19 years and 40-59"
"years are stable over time, whilst a steady increase is observed in the proportion of cases aged 20-39 years, concurrent"
with a proportional decrease in the 60-79 and 80+ years age groups.

"24 February through 13 April, 2020. (n=715 130)"

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,

Definition of contact,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
,protective equipment 1 ; OR
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,
