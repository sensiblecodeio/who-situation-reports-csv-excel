SUBJECT IN FOCUS
1. Updated strategy to help guide public health response to COVID-19
"WHO published the first Strategic Response and Preparedness Plan on 3 February 2020. Since then, we have learnt a"
"huge amount about COVID-19, and how best to slow and stop it spreading through communities around the world."
"WHO has been rapidly translating this new knowledge into guidance for national governments, health workers, and"
"everyone else involved in the global response to COVID-19. On 14 April, WHO published a strategy update reflecting"
what we have learnt to inform the next iteration of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) due in the
coming weeks.
The update is intended to help guide the public health response to COVID-19 at national and subnational level. The
"update emphasizes the need to tailor the response to COVID-19 carefully to local contexts, however, there are some"
important lessons that can be applied in a broad range of situations.
"One important lesson is that the faster and the more effective we are at finding all suspected cases of COVID-19,"
"testing, isolating and treating the confirmed cases and tracing their contacts, then the harder we make it for the"
"virus to spread. This in turn makes it easier for health systems to cope, deliver quality care, and save lives."
"This principle applies in all contexts, but it can sometimes be a challenge to put into practice even in settings with"
"ample resources. Together with the whole UN system, WHO has worked and is continuing to work closely with all"
"partners and national governments to ensure that all populations, but especially the most vulnerable populations,"
"including those in humanitarian settings, benefit from a coordinated and effective response. Alongside the SPRP,"
"that applies to all countries, the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (issued on 25 March 2020), sets out"
the most urgent health and humanitarian actions required to prepare and respond to COVID -19 in the most fragile
contexts.
The update also sets out key criteria and considerations for countries that are considering lifting some of the
"widespread restrictions on movement, often termed “lockdowns”, that have been used to suppress the spread of"
"COVID-19 through communities. By ensuring these criteria are met, it should be possible for countries to sustain a"
steady state of low-level or no transition at the same time as resuming some social and economic activities.
"However, without careful planning, and in the absence of scaled up public health and clinical care capacities, the"
premature lifting of physical distancing measures is likely to lead to an uncontrolled resurgence in COVID -19
transmission and an amplified second wave of cases.
"Finally, the update sets out the shift required in the international system to support countries to plan, finance and"
implement their response to COVID-19. The world has never faced this scale of challenge before. COVID-19 is a truly
"global crisis, and the only way to overcome it is together, in global solidarity."

2. Partner Coordination,
Emergency Medical Teams (EMT),
•,"Over a hundred EMTs and focal points worldwide are working closely with the EMT Secretariat, and are"
,"continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international COVID -19 response"
,"operations. A weekly Global Coordination Call is held, providing the network with updates on current operations,"
,"technical guidance, and sharing of current experiences and practices from various EMT responses to COVID -19."
•,"As of 19 April, international EMTs have deployed to fifteen countries. Thirty-two EMTs are responding nationally"
,to support and reinforce the local health systems in all Regions.
•,"The EMT Secretariat met with the Regional Group for the European Region on 17 April. Following discussions,"
,there was an agreement for the Secretariat to provide regular updates and present the types of support needed
,globally in order to raise awareness and facilitate deployments of available EMTs.
•,"Recently, Chinese EMTs were deployed to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, and UK EMT to Zambia. Additional"
,"deployments of Chinese EMTs are under discussion to Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe."
,"Requests from Botswana, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Yemen are also being processed."
•,The following guidance and recommendations have been finalized: technical guidance on COVID-19 community
,facilities and treatment centres; recommendations on pre-hospital emergency medical services; and
,recommendations for medical surge capacity and deployments of EMTs. A modularized just-in-time training
,package on COVID-19 for the EMT workforce is currently being finalised.
Global Health Cluster (GHC),
•,All 29 countries with IASC activated Health Clusters/Sectors are reporting confirmed COVID -19 cases. The 900
,national and international health cluster partners are urgently responding to COVID-19 specific needs whilst
,maintaining essential health services for 65 million people affected by humanitarian crises.
•,The GHC is collaborating with other clusters to inform adaptive approaches to implement key public health
,actions in complex setting (e.g. isolation in camp-like settings with Shelter and Camp Coordination and Camp
,Management Clusters).
•,"Updating of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) has been launched at country and global level,"
,"involving partner consultation, and consideration of including additional countries."
•,A GHC COVID-19 Task Team is being established to (i) Identify & promote minimum standards for humanitarian
,settings; (ii) support multi-sectoral action; and (iii) intensify advocacy to address unmet needs/ operational
,barriers. The Task Team will build upon and strengthen existing global partner initiatives with strong field driven
,engagement to capture operational practice and lessons.
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN),
WHO continues to facilitate direct and remote technical assistance to countries through GOARN regional and global,
"network of networks to support health operation. UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are embedded in the global",
COVID-19 incident management team in Geneva; and are supporting all pillars of response. Work is ongoing to,
launch public information hub on GOARN Knowledge Platform for COVID-19 to share resources from partners and,
other stakeholders.,
GOARN activities include:,
•,Operational coordination;
•,"Collaboration on training and capacity building, including Field Epidemiology Training Programmes, regional and"
,"global networks, and alumni networks;"

• Roll out and implementation of Go.Data; and,
• Response research (including support to COVID-19 Research Innovation and Research Roadmap working groups).,
Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE),
"IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO with GOARN support are strengthening coordination and collaboration among key",
stakeholders at the global and regional levels in risk communications and community engagement (RCCE). As the,
"COVID-19 pandemic develops into a global humanitarian crisis, there is increasing coordination with IASC Results",
Group 2 on Accountability and Inclusion and its humanitarian partners to join and align efforts in regard to country,
"operations, solutions and tools for stronger community engagement and accountability approaches on the ground.",
•,"The RCCE global strategy has been completed, and is a ‘live’ document that will be revised and enhanced"
,following the Strategic Preparedness Response Plan revision and Global Humanitarian Response Plan
•,"Strengthened coordination of partners with a focus on needs of migrants and vulnerable populations,"
,community engagement in remote populations and addressing reports of stigma and xenophobia.
•,Work is ongoing to a launch public information hub for COVID-19 on GOARN Knowledge Platform to share
,"RCCE resources from partners and other stakeholders, and enable access to RCCE information."
•,"A rapid consultation on social, cultural, behavioural perspectives in the COVID-19 response was undertaken."
,"Briefs were completed on information, misinformation, disinformation and on compliance with physical"
,distancing measures for COVID-19 and implications for RCCE in Eastern and Southern Africa (April 2020). A
,GOARN RCCE Data Collection Tools Repository was developed for rapid access to tools for COVID-19 RCCE
,data collection. Africa and Asia RCCE coordination groups are triangulating community insights with the
,intent to inform RCCE priorities and strategies within these regions.
•,A joint “live” guidance has been developed on “Community Engagement and COVID-19 Movement
,Restrictions: Tips for Engaging People in Low-Resource Settings Remotely and In-Person”.
•,Guidance and webinars on engagement with faith-based organizations and religious leaders are underway
,this week ahead of Ramadan. A community action guide with tips for individuals and communities to take
,simple actions to support and protect people around them during the epidemic is available here.

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

,,preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID -19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,

Definition of contact,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
,protective equipment 1 ; OR
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,
