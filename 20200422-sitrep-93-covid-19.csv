SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Infodemic management: the right information at the right time
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response requires rapid action from multiple sectors of society and government.
Individuals need to adopt new behaviors; societies need to implement new public health measures; businesses need
to develop new services to operate differently; faith leaders need to change practices to protect their communities;
and the sports and entertainment sectors need to make difficult decisions to protect the public’s health. For this to
"happen, people need answers to their questions and advice designed for their needs and contexts. The WHO"
"Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, specifically"
to meet these information demands and those of future pandemics and emergencies.
"Since January 2020, EPI-WIN has been engaging with some of the most vital sectors involved in the COVID-19"
"response through amplification webinars. The partnerships with the healthcare, business, faith, travel and tourism,"
food and agriculture and high-visibility events (sports and entertainment) sectors have helped EPI-WIN broaden the
global reach of WHO’s life-saving risk communication messages significantly.
The Network has reached more than 160 health organizations or professional associations that bring together
millions of frontline healthcare workers – the backbone of a country's defenses to save lives and limit the spread of
disease. It also provided illustrated guidance to caretakers at home who play a vital role when health systems
become overstretched.
"In addition to engaging the health community, EPI-WIN has connected with the world’s employers and employees."
"With over 3 billion people in paid employment globally, the business sector serves as a major amplifier of information."
"EPI-WIN has directly connected with more than 400 businesses in food, agriculture, travel and tourism."
Approximately 84% of the world’s population identifies with a religious group and sadly many outbreaks of COVID-19
have been linked to faith gatherings. Faith-based organizations can and need to mobilize and inform millions of
"people through their churches, mosques, synagogues and temples. EPI-WIN has worked directly with more than 60"
faith organizations to recommend critically important health behaviors for faith settings.
"The Network also combats misinformation by providing transparent, evidence-based guidance as events unfold. The"
"COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, making the need for updated, accurate and trusted information"
"even more critical. EPI-WIN meets this information need, through behavior change and myth-busting messages. EPI-"
WIN’s science-based information has supported WHO’s website and social media channels. The EPI-WIN messaging
is used on WHO’s COVID-19 website which has received 147 million page views since 22 January 2020. This
"information also fed the Google coronavirus page which received hundreds of millions of visitors every day, as well"
as a record of over 14.5 million users on WhatsApp and Viber.
EPI-WIN will continue to adapt and grow to meet the information needs of specific audiences as COVID-19 continues
and as the world faces other future public health threats.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Safe Ramadan practices in the context of the COVID-19
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting
"from sunrise to sunset, prayer and reflection. It is marked by numerous religious and social gatherings, as families"
"and friends unite to break their fast together, after sunset during iftar or before dawn during suhour."
"As this year Ramadan is expected to start on 23 April and end on 23 May, thus falling during the ongoing pandemic"
"of COVID-19, WHO has issued dedicated guidance on Safe Ramadan practices in the context of COVID-19. The"
"purpose is to provide advice on gatherings occurring during the month of Ramadan, or immediately preceding and"
"following it. Guidance was released on 15 April and is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish."
The document is addressed to national health authorities with the aim of facilitating their role in establishing policies
"for events. Early involvement of religious leaders in the decision-making process is also recommended, so that they"
"may disseminate information to the faithful community. In general, a strong communication strategy should ensure"
that decisions taken are explained to all those concerned in a timely and consistent manner.
"As a first step, WHO recommends that decisions to restrict, modify, postpone, cancel or proceed with holding a mass"
gathering during Ramadan should be based on a rigorous and standardized assessment of the risks associated with
such events in terms of contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Detailed guidance on risk-assessment protocols is
included in Practical considerations and recommendations for Religious Leaders and Faith-based Communities in the
"context of COVID-19, with a risk-assessment tool and decision tree. Cancelling in-person events and holding them"
"virtually, using platforms such as television, radio, digital and social media is therefore an option to be considered,"
especially if risk of transmission is significant.
The decision-making process can be facilitated by some overarching considerations related to physical distancing: for
"example, a distance of at least one metre (three feet) between people should be strictly maintained at all times"
during the event. People who are feeling unwell or have any symptoms of COVID-19 – as they may transmit the
"infection, and older people and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions should be discouraged from attending,"
as they have higher likelihood of developing severe illness.
"If it is decided that physical gatherings shall go ahead, WHO recommends that mitigation measures be applied to"
further decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission during the planned event. Mitigation measures include: improving
"the venue’s facilities and arrangements (e.g. holding the event outdoors rather than indoors, or ensuring adequate"
"ventilation), encouraging healthy practices by attendees (e.g. handwashing or taking safety steps in mosques, such"
"as using personal prayer rugs), and ensuring that premises and often-touched objects are thoroughly and regularly"
cleaned.
"The document also provides recommendations tailored to many social activities typical of Ramadan, such as the"
"practice of charity (sadaqat or zakah), or the traditional iftar banquets, suggesting ways to safely live in full the spirit"
"of Ramadan as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Additional considerations pertaining to fasting, physical activity,"
"healthy diet and nutrition, and tobacco use, as well as to mental and psycho-social health and response to domestic"
"violence are also proposed with the aim of clarifying misconceptions, and providing advice that may help make the"
most out of the holy month of Ramadan and its myriad of celebrations.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
"A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",,
"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",,

,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;,
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;,
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal,
,protective equipment 1 ; OR,
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.,
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",,
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a,,
"probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to",,
COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here.,,
