SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
"(SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19"
"The first human cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, subsequently"
"named SARS-CoV-2 were first reported by officials in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Retrospective"
investigations by Chinese authorities have identified human cases with onset of symptoms in early December 2019.
"While some of the earliest known cases had a link to a wholesale food market in Wuhan, some did not. Many of the"
"initial patients were either stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to this market. Environmental samples"
"taken from this market in December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the market in"
Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak. The market
was closed on 1 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified in early January and its genetic sequence shared publicly on 11-12 January. The full
genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the early human cases and the sequences of many other virus isolated from
human cases from China and all over the world since then show that SARS-CoV-2 has an ecological origin in bat
populations. All available evidence to date suggests that the virus has a natural animal origin and is not a
manipulated or constructed virus. Many researchers have been able to look at the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2
and have found that evidence does not support that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct. If it were a constructed
"virus, its genomic sequence would show a mix of known elements. This is not the case."
"Another coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, the cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, was"
"also closely related to other coronaviruses isolated from bats. These close genetic relations of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-"
"CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, suggest that they all have their ecological origin in bat populations. Many of these"
"coronaviruses can also infect several animal species. For example, SARS-CoV-1 infected civet cats and then humans,"
"while the virus causing the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) is found in dromedary camels, and has"
continued to infect humans since 2012.
All available evidence for COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source. Since there is usually limited
"close contact between humans and bats, it is more likely that transmission of the virus to humans happened through"
"another animal species, one that is more likely to be handled by humans. This intermediate animal host or zoonotic"
"source could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been"
identified.
All the published genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human cases are very similar. This suggests that the
start of the outbreak resulted from a single point introduction in the human population around the time that the
"virus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China in December 2019."
A number of investigations to better understand the source of the outbreak in China are currently underway or
"planned, including investigations of human cases with symptom onset in and around Wuhan in late 2019,"
"environmental sampling from markets and farms in areas where the first human cases were identified, and detailed"
records on the source and type of wildlife species and farmed animals sold in these markets.
Results from these studies are essential to preventing further zoonotic introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the human
"population. WHO continues to collaborate with animal health and human health experts, Member States, and other"
"partners to identify gaps and research priorities for the control of COVID-19, including the eventual identification of"
the source of the virus in China.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
"A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",,
"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",,

,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;,
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;,
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal,
,protective equipment1; OR,
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.,
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",,
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a,,
"probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to",,
COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here.,,
