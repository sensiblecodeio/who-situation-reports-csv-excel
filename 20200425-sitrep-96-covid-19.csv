‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,

countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. Within a given,,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts,
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further",
,international spread*;,
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;",
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;,
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment",
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;",
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;,
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.,
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",,
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",,
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",,
risk communication.,,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,

,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,

Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
