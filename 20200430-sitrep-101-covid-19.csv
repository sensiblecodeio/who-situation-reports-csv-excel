SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Detection of disease – an update on laboratory services for COVID-19
Diagnostic laboratory testing is a cornerstone of the management of the COVID -19 pandemic. It allows for the
detection of cases to inform care and for the isolation of infected individuals to interrupt disease transmission.
Confirmatory testing also enables the disease to be tracked in the community and for clusters of cases to be
identified. WHO endeavours to ensure that all Member States have timely and accurate testing capacity for COVID-
19. This is done through several mechanisms.
"First, a reference laboratory network has been established across the 6 WHO regions, and recently expanded to"
"include some two dozen laboratories with expertise in virology, diagnostics, sequencing, and often viral culture (see"
Figure 2 below). These laboratories act to support Member States that currently do not have testing capacity or need
to get confirmation of their initial test results while building in-country capacity. These same laboratories serve as a
valuable source of support for strategic planning for the WHO HQ team and provide guidance to the WHO Regional
Office laboratory focal points as well. A shipment fund to allow transport of samples to WHO reference laboratories
for confirmatory testing has been made available to cover transport costs.
"Second, working with WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, surveillance testing for COVID -19"
"disease has been established in clinics caring for patients with respiratory disease, giving an early hint to community
penetration by COVID-19."
Figure 2. WHO COVID-19 Reference Laboratory Network
"Third, since February 24 th WHO has been providing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits for COVID-19 directly to"
"countries, offering Member States the capacity to detect cases or clusters before the disease gains a strong foothold."
The scale of provision of tests is set to rise to millions of tests per month with the recent formation of the
Diagnostics Consortium of donor and technical agencies convened by WHO to align and coordinate procurement of
validated diagnostic test kits and related laboratory materials.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further"
,international spread*;
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,
"• To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.",
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and"
,"in health care settings in the context of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and"
,"control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and"
,community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19.
•,
,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The"
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,"
,"epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection"
,"prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are"
,updated regularly.
•,"WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment,"
,medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with COVID-19.
•,WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
