Situation Report – 102,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 1 May 2020",,
This report has been reformatted to improve accessibility for persons with visual impairment.,,
Highlights,,
Two new Member States (Comoros and Tajikistan) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.,,
The third meeting of the Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General under the,,
International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding COVID-19.,,
"The WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge mentioned that “we will defeat COVID-",,
"19 by disseminating knowledge in all transparency, by personalized support in the field and by",,
"unfailing solidarity”. In another statement, he emphasized that “we cannot allow the impact of COVID-",,
19 to be amplified by neglecting other vital health protection measures”.,,
The WHO Regional Office for the Americas urged health authorities to take specific steps to protect,,
health care workers and communities during essential immunization activities throughout the COVID-,,
19 pandemic.,,
WHO virtually convened vaccine manufacturers and national regulatory authorities from its South-,,
East Asia Region to discuss COVID-19 vaccines.,,
"In the Subject in Focus below, we describe WHO’s work to ensure that shipping and seafarers can",,
"continue to deliver vital goods, including medical supplies and food during the COVID-19 pandemic",,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,3 175 207 cases (84 771),224 172 deaths (6403)
Africa,26 663 cases (1950),973 deaths (35)
Americas,1 291 917 cases (45 727),69 087 deaths (3859)
Eastern Mediterranean,188 585 cases (6168),7598 deaths (151)
Europe,1 461 404 cases (26764),138 200 deaths (2239)

Western Pacific,148 838 cases (1095),6127 deaths (33)

Subject in focus
"Partnership coordination to facilitate ship movements during COVID-19, including the issuance of Ship"
Sanitation Certificates
"On April 22, 2020 the Directors-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the"
International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Secretary-General of the International Maritime
"Organization (IMO) issued a joint statement on medical certificates of seafarers, ship sanitation"
"certificates and medical care of seafarers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO, IMO"
"and the ILO, in cooperation with international seafarers’ and ship-owners’ organizations, are"
"working together to ensure the ability of shipping and seafarers to continue to deliver vital goods,"
including medical supplies and food.
"In the statement, the three organizations strongly encourage governments to facilitate ship"
"movements, including docking, crew changes, ship inspection and the issuance of Ship Sanitation"
Certificates (SSCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Under the framework of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), State Parties are"
"required to authorize ports to conduct ship inspections and issue Ship Sanitation Certificates, as"
"well as to provide the services referred to in Annex 1 of the IHR, which expands on an important set"
of core capacities for points of entry. The scope of the application of SSCs is delineated in the WHO
Handbook for inspection of ships and issuance of ship sanitation certificates. A ship without a valid
SSC (e.g. carrying an expired SSC) is considered an ‘affected’ ship and is subject to health
"measures, as deemed necessary by the health authorities, to prevent the spread of diseases."
The SSCs are valid for a maximum period of six months and this period may be extended by one
month if the inspection or control measures required cannot be accomplished at the port.
"However, in the current situation, renewals of SSCs may not be possible at ports due to port"
closures and other restriction measures put in place by countries. This in turn could impede the
movement of ships as ships without SSCs are considered ‘affected’. To facilitate the renewal of
"ship sanitation certificates and prevent unnecessary interference to international maritime traffic,"
extraordinary temporary measures have been introduced. These are referred to in the joint
"statement with regard to the renewal of SSCs, as well as ship inspections, and protective"
measures against COVID-19.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
Council resolution 1244 (1999).,
"In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for",
visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases and deaths reported under the international conveyance (Diamond,
Princess).,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories”include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
"Erratum 1 May 2020, Map (figure 1): Russian Federation was erroneously shown as ‘no cases",
