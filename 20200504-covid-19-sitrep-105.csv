Subject in Focus: Update on Partner Coordination,
"Many partners have been working closely with WHO from the beginning of the response, both at",
"WHO headquarters and in the field. UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are major partners embedded in",
"the global COVID-19 incident management team in Geneva, and are supporting all pillars of response.",
127 Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) are registered in the Global Classification,
(https://extranet.who.int/emt/) of which 29 are already classified and 98 under the classification,
"process. To date, a total of 19 EMTs have been deployed internationally and another 36 EMTs are",
"supporting national operations in the response to COVID-19, providing support to 15 countries.",
"As of 27 April 2020, EMT operations have significantly increased in Africa - the region with the most",
"international operations, followed by the European Region. In particular, large EMTs have been",
"deployed to Italy, Cambodia, Mongolia and Kyrgystan. 58 training sessions have been conducted with",
more than 3100 front line responders trained.,
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners are: supporting risk assessment and,
"strategic and operational planning; and providing technical advice across all health operation pillars,",
"particularly clinical management, IPC, laboratory and risk communication and community engagement",
(RCCE).,
"As of 4 May, 2020, 400 offers of support have been received from GOARN partners. This includes a",
"large express of interest from “One Health” partners, particularly from the South-East Asia and the",
"Western Pacific Regions. Current support includes missions to Ethiopia, São Tomé and Príncipe,",
"Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste.",
"Esri, the global leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, is providing a free and",
comprehensive ArcGIS package to all GOARN partners and ministries of health to support the COVID-,
19 response. WHO and GOARN partners are working to facilitate online ArcGIS training to build and,
improve the operational capacity of partners. WHO is assessing GIS training needs and capacity among,
GOARN partners.,
"Asia and Africa RCCE regional coordination groups are triangulating operational social science data,",
"including community feedback data, sentiments and perception analysis and online data mining. This",
will better inform decision-making and community engagement strategies. The goal is to progressively,
connect partners collecting data into a more comprehensive and coordinated reporting and,
monitoring system available to all. At regional and global level RCCE teams are exploring the,
development of interagency dashboards for visualizing data to better inform operational response,
planning.,
"IFRC, UNICEF and WHO, in close coordination with GOARN and support from the Bill and Melinda",
"Gates Foundation, are working towards the establishment of a RCCE Global Collective Service to assist",
the public health and humanitarian response. This will build on the existing coordination efforts,
"towards providing global, regional and country support across to the health and humanitarian",
architecture.,
"In RCCE, the focus area this week includes:",
•,"Post lockdown engagement of communities including on reopening of schools, handwashing"
,campaign and engagement with faith based organizations on religious festivals including
,Ramadan.

•,Compilation of tips on community of engagement in low resource settings developed and,
,"disseminated among partners, offering good practice examples and innovative outreach",
,solutions.,
•,Community engagement data is being triangulated in the group to better utilize and inform,
,IMST decision making:,
,o,Exploring regional interagency dashboards for CE data to better inform operational
,,response planning.
,o,Rumour monitoring ongoing among partners like Internews. The goal is to better
,,connect partners collecting data into a more comprehensive reporting and monitoring
,,system available to all.
•,Proactive WHO and UNICEF engagement with faith-based organizations is being undertaken to,
,ensure that religious events and customs are aligned with the infection prevention and control,
,principles of this outbreak response.,
"On the occasion of World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May, UNICEF is mobilizing global RCCE partners to",,
scale up handwashing outreach for COVID-19 prevention and Operationalization of the interim,,
recommendations on obligatory hand hygiene against transmission of COVID-19.,,

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
Council resolution 1244 (1999).,
"In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for",
visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases and deaths reported under the international conveyance (Diamond,
Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such reconciliation exercises have taken place. When additional details become,
"available in future which allow the subtractions to be apportioned to previous days, numbers will",
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be retrospectively updated; the most up -to-,
date data can always be found at covid19.who.int,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,

"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata"
