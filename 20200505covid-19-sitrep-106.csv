Situation Report – 106,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 5 May 2020",,
This report has been reformatted to improve accessibility for persons with visual impairment.,,
Highlights,,
Every year on May 5 we celebrate Hand Hygiene Day to mobilize people around the world to increase,,
"adherence to hand hygiene practices in healthcare facilities. In his media briefing, the Director-General",,
"reminded us that ‘around the world, fewer than two-thirds of healthcare facilities are equipped with",,
"hand hygiene stations, and 3 billion people lack soap and water at home’. Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh,",,
"WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, said that ‘Effective infection prevention and control",,
"measures, including hand hygiene, are crucial to ensuring health facilities do not become hubs of",,
COVID-19 transmission’.,,
A WHO COVID-19 mission has arrived in Tajikistan to support the country’s response to the pandemic.,,
Today also marks the International Day of the Midwife. Midwives provide life-saving services to,,
"pregnant women, ensuring healthy outcomes for women and their babies. As the Director-General said",,
"in his media briefing, ‘They’re risking their lives to give life to others.’ WHO Regional Office for Europe",,
has released a news article of the experiences of a midwife in Italy.,,
Yesterday leaders from 40 countries around the world came together to support the Access to COVID-,,
"19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a WHO initiative to support the development, production and equitable",,
"distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics against COVID-19. Some €7.4 billion were pledged,",,
in what the Director-General described as a ‘powerful and inspiring demonstration of global,,
solidarity’.,,

Subject in Focus: Operations Support and Logistics update
UN-led purchasing consortium procures diagnostic tests for delivery to 135 countries
"Unprecedented global demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), ventilators and other critical items for"
the COVID-19 response has resulted in acute supply shortages. WHO is working across several different sectors
to enable countries with the most limited means to access markets for vital medical supplies to tackle the
COVID-19 pandemic.
"WHO – together with other UN agencies, NGOs and donor partners – are negotiating collectively with"
"manufacturers through a pooled procurement process, to address global market shortages in the three"
categories of vital supplies essential for the COVID-19 response: PPE; diagnostics; and biomedical equipment.
"With support from the Solidarity Response Fund, the diagnostics consortium has secured 4 million manual"
"Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests for $49 million, and initiated purchase orders for allocation and"
distribution to 135 countries for the month of May. These initial purchases will serve as a catalyst for securing
"supplies for additional procurement, as payments from countries receiving these deliveries will provide"
additional funding for procuring more supplies and equipment for allocation and delivery in the coming months.
WHO is engaged in discussions with suppliers to explore further channels of cooperation for sourcing pooled
"procurement of PPE, testing supplies and biomedical equipment. Through a purchasing consortium for PPE,"
"contracts have been secured from Chinese and Malaysian manufacturers for substantial volumes of masks,"
gloves and other critical supplies to protect frontline healthcare workers. WHO is currently in the process of
"placing purchase orders for these supplies, while the consortium continues efforts to secure additional"
quantities of PPE.
WHO continues to strongly advocate for the urgent need to increase production of these life-saving supplies to
strengthen response capacity of Member States confronting the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 Supply Portal Launch
WHO has launched a new COVID-19 Supply Portal.
The COVID-19 Supply Portal is a purpose-built tool to facilitate and consolidate submission of supply requests
from national authorities and all implementing partners supporting COVID-19 National Action Plans. Those
requests will then be matched against purchasing agencies of the Consortia that can execute the order and
"process it, utilizing their existing ordering systems. A catalogue of items that can be requested is available online"
"and is broadly divided into three categories: personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and clinical"
"management. The Portal is accessed via the COVID-19 Partners Platform, which is accessed here, and provides"
further information including a video and guide to requesting and receiving supplies and frequently asked
questions.
"Guidance on its roll-out and use has been provided to the UN Development Coordination Office, WHO Regional"
"Directors, UN agencies and other key actors. WHO is preparing a circular to introduce the Portal to Member"
States and national authorities.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
Council resolution 1244 (1999).,
"In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for",
visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases and deaths reported under the international conveyance (Diamond,
Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such reconciliation exercises have taken place. When additional details become,
"available in future which allow the subtractions to be apportioned to previous days, numbers will",
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be retrospectively updated; the most up -to-,
date data can always be found at covid19.who.int,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,

"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata"
"Puerto Rico, Guatemala, and occupied Palestinian territory data has been updated."
