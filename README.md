# World Health Organization Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) PDF situation reports available in Excel and CSV formats

The World Health Organization are releasing daily [Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) in PDF format. We have made each situation report freely available in Excel and CSV formats in this GitHub repository.

This repository will be updated regularly.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at hello@pdftables.com

## UPDATE 1st December 2020

**We will no longer be updating this repository with new reports. If you would like these PDF reports to be converted to XLSX, CSV, XML or HTML, please contact us at hello@pdftables.com.**

## UPDATE 17th August 2020

The World Health Organization are now releasing weekly epidemiological updates and therefore converted reports will be uploaded at the beginning of each week, rather than every day.
