SITUATION REPORT - 6,,
26 JANUARY 2020,,
Data as reported by: 26 January 20201,,
SUMMARY,,
Situation update:,,
•,"On 26 January 2020, the number of reported confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)",
,has increased by 694 cases since the last situation report published yesterday.,

,-,One case in Australia had direct contact with a confirmed case from Wuhan while in China;
,-,One case in Australia reported today; travel history is not yet known.
,-,One case in Viet Nam had no travel history but was in contact with a confirmed case (his
,,"father with travel history to Wuhan), resulting from human to human transmission within"
,,a family.
•,"Of the 1,975 confirmed cases (excluding Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and Taipei), 324 cases have",
,been reported as severely ill 2 .,
•,Fifty-six deaths have been reported to date (52 deaths in Hubei province and 4 from outside,
,Hubei).,
WHO’s assessment of the risk of this event has not changed since the last risk assessment conducted,,
"on 22 January: very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level. 3",,
1The situation report includes information reported to WHO Geneva by 10 AM CET,,
2 Severe illness: According to any of the following criteria:,,
(1) shortness of breath; (2) respiratory rate more than 30 bpm; (3) hypoxemia; (4) chest X-ray with multi-lobar infiltrates or pulmonary,,
,infiltration progressed more than 50% within 24 - 48 hours.,
"3 Note: Error in situation reports published on 23,24 and 25 January as originally published, which incorrectly summarized the risk for",,

I. SURVEILLANCE,,
Limiting international spread of 2019-nCoV depends on understanding the global epidemiology. Key,,
questions that global surveillance must answer include the following:,,
-,How fast is 2019-nCoV spreading from China to other countries?,
-,Where are cases exported from and to?,
-,What types of exposures are reported by travellers originating in Wuhan or in other,
,provinces in China reporting cases and human to human transmission?,
-,Are individuals symptomatic before travel and potentially detectable through exit or entry,
,screening?,
-,Is there person-to-person transmission occurring in countries reporting imported cases?,
-,What is the clinical presentation of illness among travellers?,
WHO requests countries to notify WHO of cases following the guidance included in,,
https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-,,
coronavirus-(2019-ncov),,

II. PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE:,
WHO:,
• WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been,
reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as,
,requested.
•,Developed the surveillance case definitions and reporting forms for human infection with 2019-
,nCoV and is updating it as the new information becomes available.
•,"Developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection prevention"
,"and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus ,"
,risk communication and community engagement.
•,Prepared disease commodity package for supplies necessary in identification and management
,of confirmed patients.
•,Provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.
•,WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the
,novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
•,"Activation of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics."
•,WHO is providing guidance on early investigations. The first protocol that is available is a:
,Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
,infection.
•,WHO has developed an online course to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory
,"viruses, including novel coronaviruses."
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an"
,outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the study protocols can be used to refine
,"recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological"
,"transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease,"
,impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. The first protocol that is"
,available is a: Household transmission investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-
,nCoV) infection.
•,WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on
,"surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways"
,"to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim"
,"guidance for countries, updated to take into account the current situation."
•,"Utilizing global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and"
,"control, clinical management and mathematical modelling."
WHO is working with networks of specialists to analyze 2019-nCoV full genome sequences as they,
become available.,
WHO has not received evidence that the virus has changed. WHO awaits further information from,
Chinese officials.,

"Current estimates of the incubation period range from 2-10 days, and these estimates will be refined",
as more data become available. Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the,
"virus to others is critical for control efforts. In previous outbreaks of other coronavirus, such as",
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), some individuals can be asymptomatic",
and transmit to others. Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed,
to determine the infectious period of 2019-nCoV.,
"WHO has issued advice to people on how to protect themselves from 2019-nCoV infection, as for",
any virus that spreads via the respiratory route: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-,
coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public,
"In addition, it is vitally important in health care settings, that health care workers are able to protect",
themselves from infection. WHO guidance on infection prevention and control measures in health,
care facilities is here: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-,
during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected,
The strategic objectives of the response are to interrupt the transmission of the virus from one,
"person to another in China, to prevent exportation of cases from China to other countries and",
"territories, and to prevent further transmission from exported case if they were to happen. This can",
"be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and",
"control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness raising",
"in the population, risk communication.",
,During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
,"and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human to human transmission occurred"
,"through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV"
,can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory
,infections include the following:
•,Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
•,"Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment."
•,Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
•,People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain
,"distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands)."
•,"Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in"
,"hospitals, especially in emergency departments."
WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms,
"suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek",
medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Travel guidance was,
77updated on 24 January.,

III. COUNTRY RESPONSE:,
China:,
•,Public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene further strengthened in
,"public places across the city, farmers’ markets in particular. As of 23 January, the National"
,Health Commission revised protection standards and specifications for medical workers and
,strengthened prevention and control measures against 2019-nCoV in hospitals.
•,National authorities are conducting active case finding in all provinces.
•,Search expanded for additional cases within and outside of Wuhan.
•,Active / retroactive case finding in medical institutions in Wuhan.
•,The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was closed on 1 January 2020 for
,environmental sanitation and disinfection. Market inspection in expansion to other markets.
