SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Infodemics Management – Enabling Safer Workplaces in a time of COVID-19,
WHO’s Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) website: www.who.int/epi-win was launched on 24 March and,
"gives people access to timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand advice and information from trusted sources on the",
"evolving COVID-19 pandemic, translating scientific information to actionable information. EPI-WIN’s two-way",
"communication network addresses key information needs while rebutting misinformation and fighting infodemics,",
"which spread misinformation, create confusion and distrust among people and hamper an effective response.",
The EPI-WIN website is aimed at a wide range of audiences including,
•,individuals and communities
•,"the health sector,"
•,"countries,"
•,"the travel and tourism sector,"
•,"faith-based organizations and faith leaders,"
•,"large event organizers, and"
•,employers and employees.
"Of the world’s population of around 8 billion, over 3 billion are in paid employment. National and international trade",
unions represent the rights and welfare of workers not only in relation to employment but also often in relation to,
their families and communities and are regarded as trusted sources of information and advice by their members.,
EPI-WIN is engaging closely with employers and workers through different entities and organizations that serve as,
amplifiers with the capacity to reach vast numbers of people with life-saving information and guidance. The,
International Organization of Employers alone reaches 50 million businesses in 150 countries. Among several other,
"entities and organizations, EPI-WIN has strong links with trade unions through the International Labour Organization",
"(ILO)’s the Bureau of Workers’ Activities (ACTRAV), the International Trade Union Confederation and the global",
"sectoral unions, reaching over 210 million workers and their families in 163 countries.",
"To best respond to the need for timely information of these different audiences, EPI-WIN conducts regular calls with",
"the different sectors. On March 23 rd, WHO and the International Occupational Medicine Society Collaboration",
(IOMSC) conducted a webinar on “Occupational Health Measures in the Preparedness and Response to COVID19 in,
the Workplace.” Approximately 225 participants registered for the webinar including IOMSC Occupational Medical,
Society members as well as other Occupational Medical Society physician leaders from around the world. Participant,
questions were notably around the themes of: workplace transmission of COVID-19; the use of masks and other,
personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare and other public-facing workers; the use of rapid tests for COVID-,
19 to screen workers in workplaces; “Return to Work” guidance; and mental health and psychosocial impacts in,
"workplaces, in particular health facilities.",
"Two additional webinars are scheduled for Thursday, 26 March the first with the European Federation of Public",
"Service Unions (EPSU), representing 8 million workers, and the second a videoconference with the International",
Organization of Employers (IOE): “Summit on the collaboration of the private sector with health systems in,
emergency situations.”,
Employers and employees have a crucial role to play in stopping COVID-19 and reducing the impact of the,
disease on society. A key area of EPI-WIN’s work focuses on how to create a COVID-safe workplace and prevent,
transmission of the disease between employees through the following measures:,
Preventing transmission of COVID-19 between employees,
• Implement remote work practices (tele-working),
• Social distancing measures in the workplace when on-site presence is required (at least 1 metre),

•,Hold fewer in- person meetings
•,Restrict the number of visitors entering the workplace
•,Limit travel beyond non-essential travel
•,Ensure people with symptoms or with family members with symptoms self-quarantine for 14 days
•,Check the body temperature of employees daily so that employees with fever don’t come to work
•,Facilitate access to reliable information for employees to promote understanding of the disease and its
,"symptoms and the personal preventative measures (respiratory etiquette, hand washing, self-isolation if"
,sick)
•,Check and follow the advice from the authorities in the community before holding a meeting or event;
,"follow all necessary precautions, protective and self-isolation measures, should a meeting go ahead."
Maintain a safe and healthy work environment,
•,Develop a business continuity plan
•,Develop a contingency and business continuity plan for an outbreak in the communities where your business
,operates and for when your employees return to work during or after COVID-19 according to national and
,local health authorities.
•,"Promote regular and thorough hand washing by employees, contractors and customers, as well as good"
,respiratory hygiene.
•,"Clean workspaces frequently with disinfectant including high risk areas/space (e.g. door handle, reception"
,"counter, elevators, disinfection of working stations of COVID-19 cases)"
•,Provide alcohol-based gel or washing hands stations
•,Establish a reporting system for any cases among employees
•,Establish a system to quarantine close contacts of a suspect or confirmed case among the employees
•,Ensure good ventilation
•,Develop a food delivery system that reduces contacts with food deliverers and avoid employee lines
•,Ensure psycho-social support of employees during the pandemic. Incorporate mental health resources into
,human resources policies. Your employees may be suffering from emotional distress during this period; and
,may also suffer distress when experiencing changes like returning to work.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
