SUBJECT IN FOCUS: COVID-19 virus persistence: Implications for transmission and precaution,
recommendations,
"An experimental study, which evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2), has recently been",
"published in the NEJM 1.In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and",
fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not,
reflect normal human coughing or sneezing nor does it reflect aerosol generating procedures in clinical settings.,
"Furthermore, the findings do not bring new evidence on airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles",
potentially containing the virus was already known as a possibility during procedures generating aerosols.,
"In all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through",
respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites. 2-8The virus can spread directly from person to person when,
"a COVID-19 case coughs or exhales producing droplets that reach the nose, mouth or eyes of another person.",
"Alternatively, as the droplets are too heavy to be airborne, they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the",
"person. Other people become infected with COVID-19 by touching these contaminated objects or surfaces, then",
"touching their eyes, nose or mouth. According to the currently available evidence, transmission through smaller",
droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to,
aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients.,
"As such, WHO continues to recommend that everyone performs hand hygiene frequently, follows respiratory",
etiquette recommendations and regularly clean and disinfect surfaces. WHO also continues to recommend the,
importance of maintaining physical distances and avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms. These,
preventive measures will limit viral transmission.,
"Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, and in alignment with available evidence, WHO maintains the",
"recommendation, in the context of droplet and contact precautions for the use of medical masks for regular care of",
"COVID-19 patients and respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3) for circumstances and settings where aerosol generating",
procedures are performed. 9,

‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become,,,,,,,
available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is,,,,,,,
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within,,,,,,,
"categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and",,,,,,,
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.,,,,,,,
Terms:,,,,,,,
-,"Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by",,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,
•,"To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.",
•,"WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and",
,"in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management,",
,"infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel",
,"coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with",
,novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).,
•,WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a,
,"guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The",
,guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.,
•,WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also,
,informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.,
•,"WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance,",

,o,COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country
,,preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
