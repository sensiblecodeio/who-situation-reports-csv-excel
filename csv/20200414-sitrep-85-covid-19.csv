"SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO strengthening supply networks, forecasting required supplies,",
and sending critical shipments,
COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force,
"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create an acute shortage of essential supplies, including personal protective",
"equipment, diagnostics and medical equipment. On 8 April 2020, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros announced a",
Supply Chain Task Force that will establish a COVID-19 Supply Chain System (CSCS) to provide countries with essential,
supplies for their COVID-19 response.,
The COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force will:,
a.,"Establish and implement a global strategy to ensure access to critical and life-saving supplies, as identified by"
,WHO;
b.,Bring together the collective capabilities of public and private actors to meet these needs;
c.,Ensure the flow of vital supplies and essential cargo.
Pandemic Supply Chain Network,
"WHO Operations Support and Logistics, in partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), continues to",
"engage private companies in efforts to meet the unprecedented global demand for life-saving medical equipment,",
laboratory testing supplies and personal protective equipment.,
Initial talks with manufacturers of oxygen production concentrators and ancillary equipment indicate there is,
potential to secure PSA oxygen plants for installment in the coming weeks. A number of oxygen producers have,
expressed interest in supporting WHO efforts to secure vital equipment for its stockpile and to meet intermediate to,
long-term procurement requests.,
WHO continues to deliver laboratory testing supplies to countries in need and is ramping up efforts to consolidate,
demand and work with PSCN stakeholders to ensure access and proper allocation of diagnostics equipment to,
increase testing capacity in those countries most in need.,
COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool,
"Through collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and UNICEF, OSL’s COVID-19 Essential Supplies",
"Forecasting Tool (COVID-19 ESFT) is now available online. Demonstrations have been conducted in WHO EURO,",
EMRO and AFRO regions.,
"The forecasting tool is designed to help governments, partners and other stakeholders to estimate potential",
requirements for essential supplies to respond to COVID-19 pandemic. The tool enables the projecting of essential,
"supply needs, including the estimation of personal protective equipment, diagnostic equipment, biomedical",
"equipment for case management, essential drugs for supportive care, and consumable medical supplies.",
OSL Operations Update,
"OSL has organized shipments of critical supplies from Dubai to Addis Ababa, a WFP hub, for onwards dispatch to 34",
"African countries. A plan to distribute 340 million surgical masks to 120 countries has been developed, and",
discussions are underway with WFP to prepare the distribution strategy.,
OSL is continuing efforts to establish a global supply chain coordination platform to receive country requests for,
critical supplies.,

‡ Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.,,,,,,,
§ Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may,,,,,,,

countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category reported. Within a given,,,,,,,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
