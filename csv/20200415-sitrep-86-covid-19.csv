SUBJECT IN FOCUS: providing timely and accurate information to dispel the ‘infodemic’
“We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an
infodemic.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
"Munich Security Conference, 15 February 2020"
"An infodemic is an over-abundance of information, some accurate"
and some not that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy
sources and reliable guidance when they need it. It poses a
serious problem for public health since people need this guidance
"to know what actions to take to protect themselves and others, and help mitigate the impact of a disease. In the"
"context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the infodemic is exacerbated by the global scale of the emergency, and"
propagated by the interconnected way that information is disseminated and consumed through social media
"platforms and other channels. While the infodemic is a major challenge to outbreak response, it presents an"
opportunity to identify and adapt new preparedness and response tools.
The COVID-19 infodemic spans four major thematic areas where people look for trustworthy information and where
there is misinformation and rumors: the cause and origin of the virus and disease; its symptoms and transmission
"patterns; available treatments, prophylactics and cures; and the effectiveness and impact of interventions by health"
authorities or other institutions.
WHO has been managing the infodemic through a wide range of methods such as timely and accurate technical
"guidance, scientific briefs and situation reports, regular press conferences, educational videos and trainings, “myth-"
"busters,” active engagement on social media platforms and tailored guidance for key sectors such as healthcare,"
"food and agriculture and travel and tourism, among others."
"On 7 and 8 April, the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) held a two-day, global, online consultation"
on managing the COVID-19 infodemic. The consultation gathered ideas from an interdisciplinary group of experts
"and 1,375 webinar participants. Over 500 ideas were also submitted through an online interactive forum. These"
ideas will form the basis of a COVID-19 infodemic framework to guide actions of governments and public health
"institutions, and will be made available in the coming days."
The framework will be built around four key principles:
1. Interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence.
"2. This knowledge should be translated into actionable, behaviour- changing messages, presented in ways that are"
accessible to all sectors of all societies.
"3. Governments should reach out to key communities to understand their concerns and information needs, to better"
tailor advice and messages that can help these communities address their audiences.
"4. Strategic partnerships should be formed with social media and technology platforms and stakeholders, along with"
other relevant stakeholders such as those in academia and civil society.
"The consultation highlighted clear themes and needs that will be further developed in the framework. They include,"
but are not limited to:
"• The need for (a) international coordination of the response to the infodemic, even around such basic"
issues as terminology; and (b) coordinated and integrated methods to manage the flow of information

,"for maximum positive impact. To fill these gaps, an overview and understanding of the distribution and"
,sharing of information is crucial.
•,Public trust in the health authority and other relevant authorities is essential to mitigate the negative
,"impact of an infodemic. In order to build and sustain trust, public health agencies and other authorities"
,need to be transparent about developments as they unfold.
•,Health education and health literacy are important to help people receive and act on reliable
,information.
•,"Resilience to misinformation depends on strong digital and health literacy. To facilitate this, authorities"
,"could run information campaigns on how to convey accurate information, in a similar way that they"
,promote personal hygiene.
•,Multidisciplinary cooperation is key to an effective response to an infodemic. The range and
,effectiveness of possible response measures increases in relation to the degree of cooperation between
,"all these actors, across the whole of society."
•,Widespread cultural change around the handling of online information may also be necessary (e.g.
,individuals retracting and deleting inaccurate posts they might have shared).
•,"Accurate information must be adapted to different cultures, languages and literacy capacities, extending"
,to marginalised and vulnerable communities.
•,Health education before a crisis is always hugely valuable.
"Managing the COVID-19 pandemic and related infodemic requires swift, regular, coordinated action from multiple",
"sectors of society and government. The timely translation of evidence into knowledge that people can use, adapted",
"to their local cultures, languages and contexts, will continue to be crucial to fighting misinformation and saving lives",
as the pandemic continues to evolve.,

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,
Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,

Definition of contact,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal
,protective equipment1; OR
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,
