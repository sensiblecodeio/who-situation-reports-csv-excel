SUBJECT IN FOCUS: WHO Operations Support and Logistics update
WHO leads UN collaboration to secure vital supplies for COVID-19 response
"The COVID-19 Supply Chain System (CSCS), managed by the Supply Chain Task Force, is a collaborative effort across"
"UN and non-UN actors. WHO leads the prioritisation and allocation of medical supplies and equipment, while the"
World Food Programme (WFP) acts as logistics lead to direct shipment and distribution of goods to governments or
UN country offices.
"The CSCS will identify, certify, source, allocate, direct and deliver essential medical supplies and equipment to where"
they are needed most during this acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It will have eight global hubs and will deploy sixteen 747s and medium-sized cargo aircraft, as well as passenger"
"planes for monthly shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, lab equipment, oxygen, and"
medical and technical personnel.
New humanitarian air hub in Ethiopia delivers WHO cargo of critical supplies to 32 countries across Africa
"On 14 April, the Government of Ethiopia and WFP opened a new hub at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from"
which COVID-19 supplies will be transported by air to destinations across Africa. The ‘Addis Ababa Humanitarian Air
Hub’ is part of an overall UN initiative to scale up procurement and distribution of protective equipment and medical
supplies for the COVID-19 response.
The first ‘Solidarity Flight’ left Addis Ababa on 14 April to deliver critical supplies to 32 countries in Africa to help
contain the spread of COVID-19. The airlift represents the largest single shipment of medical supplies from WHO
since the start of the pandemic. The WHO cargo was transported by the WFP and included one million face masks
"and other personal protective equipment, along with thermometers and laboratory supplies to support case"
detection and testing activities. The cargo also included a large quantity of medical supplies donated by the Jack Ma
Foundation.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is providing technical support and coordination for the
distribution of the supplies.
"Securing commitments for millions of COVID-19 tests, masks, goggles and other PPE"
"WHO has established three buyers consortia – a PPE Consortium, a Diagnostics Consortium, and a Clinical Care"
Consortium – to address global market shortages in critical supplies required for the global COVID-19 response. Each
consortium is working to ensure that some critical supplies are reserved to meet the requests of countries most in
"need, especially low- to medium income countries with severely limited resources."
The Clinton Health Access Initiative has helped the Diagnostics Consortium negotiate with manufacturers to secure
commitments for 10 million tests over the next 16 weeks.
"Market demand for clinical care equipment is estimated to be 20 times the historical demand, with oxygen"
concentrators unlikely to be available before September at the earliest. WHO continues to work with private sector
"partners on procurement efforts to secure supplies of oxygen, consumables and accessories for oxygen therapy."
"WHO is also continuing to work to secure higher volumes of masks, gloves and other vital equipment to protect"
healthcare workers and vulnerable populations.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further
international spread*;"
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;"
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment"
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;"
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",
risk communication.,

,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
