SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Partner Coordination,
Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs),
•,"A weekly Global Coordination Call continues to be held, providing the network with updates on current"
,"operations, technical guidance, and sharing of current experiences and practices from various EMT responses to"
,"COVID-19. For current operations, the EMT Secretariat provides information on requests for global support to"
,raise awareness and facilitate deployments of available EMTs.
•,Nineteen International EMTs classified and/or in the classification process have deployed to fifteen countries
,across three WHO regions.
•,Thirty-six EMTs are responding nationally to support and reinforce local health systems in all Regions.
•,"Additional deployments of Chinese EMTs are expected to Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo and"
,Zimbabwe. WHO is currently working with the EMTs and countries to facilitate additional teams to Comoros and
,São Tomé and Príncipe.
Global Health Cluster (GHC),
•,WHO and the GHC are coordinating inputs from partners on the first update of the Global Humanitarian
,"Response Plan (GHRP) including mental health and psychosocial services, gender-based violence, protection and"
,"specific needs of older people and migrants, minimum Sphere humanitarian standards, and issues related to"
,"Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)."
•,Analysis is ongoing to strengthen projections and service requirements for COVID-19 cases and wider
,humanitarian needs; and monitoring the impact of COVID-19 protection measures on access to essential health
,services.
•,Reports from field locations highlight the challenges of contact tracing and sample collection in insecure areas;
,insufficient personal protective equipment for partners supporting health facilities; and the additional challenges
,of operating with staff in self-quarantine.
•,GHC partners were briefed on the development of the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Taskforce; and a webinar was
,held for all Health Cluster Coordinators on isolation in humanitarian settings.
•,Interim Guidance on Public Health and Social Measures for COVID-19 Preparedness and Response in Low
,Capacity and Humanitarian Settings is under development.
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN),
•,"UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA continue to work closely with WHO, embedded in the global COVID-19 incident"
,management team; and are supporting all pillars of response.
•,WHO continues to facilitate direct and remote technical assistance to countries through GOARN regional and
,global networks to support health operations.
•,A public information hub has been launched on the GOARN knowledge platform for COVID-19 to facilitate the
,sharing of resources by partners and other stakeholders.

•,"IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO with GOARN support are strengthening coordination and collaboration among key"
,stakeholders at the global and regional levels in risk communications and community engagement (RCCE).
•,"With support from GOARN partners, 23 experts have been deployed or are in the process of deployment to"
,support COVID-19 response directly or remotely. WHO is currently working with GOARN partners and EMTs to
,"provide support in São Tomé and Príncipe, Timor-Leste, Italy, and Ecuador."
•,"A working group of partners has been established on contact tracing, field epidemiology, and using Go.Data to"
,assist the urgent scale up of contact tracing capacity.
Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE),
•,"The tripartite partnership of IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO is leading activities on Risk Communications and"
,Community Engagement (RCCE).
•,"The tripartite priorities and upcoming guides, research and tools include social, cultural, and behavioural insights"
,"to guide strategies and response actions. They also provide recommendations for home care, community"
,"engagement for post-lockdown, and for low-resource settings and vulnerable populations."
•,Coordination is focused on linkages between country-level RCCE efforts and broader humanitarian community
,engagement and coordination.
GOARN COVID-19 Research,
Current activities include:,
•,Support to the WHO-convened COVID-19 Research Roadmap Social Science Working Group.
•,"Support to RCCE tripartite (WHO, UNICEF, IFRC) to identify emerging research needs that GOARN can support"
,"and disseminate findings, and support to ad hoc groups to address emerging operational issues. A repository of"
,RCCE research and assessment tools is available on the GOARN COVID-19 Knowledge Hub.
•,Rapid literature searches and evidence reviews with 24-hour turn-around. Requests are through an online portal
,supported by Librarian Reserve Corps. Priority is given to GOARN operational partners and WHO technical leads.
,These outputs are sent directly to the requester and posted on the open access GOARN COVID-19 Knowledge
,Hub. The Librarian Reserve Corps also curates a daily research publications list that is posted on the open access
,GOARN COVID-19 Knowledge Hub.
•,"Support for the integration of guidance, training, and tools for contact tracing for COVID-19, including"
,"communication of practitioners, and links to Field Epidemiology Training Programmes (FETPs), alumni, regional"
,"and global networks, WHO and GOARN field epidemiology partners, and stakeholders, and the Go.Data"
,community.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts,
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further",
,international spread*;,
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;",
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;,
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment",
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;",
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;,
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.,
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",,
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",,
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",,
risk communication.,,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,

Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;,
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;,
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal,
,protective equipment1; OR,
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.,
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",,
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a,,
"probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to",,
COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here.,,
