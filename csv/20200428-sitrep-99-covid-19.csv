Sourcing Supplies – Progress Update
WHO and partners continue to work with suppliers to secure commitments for supplies needed for the COVID-19
"response in countries with limited means to access markets for personal protective equipment, diagnostic testing"
supplies and clinical care equipment.
"A diagnostic purchasing consortium, established by WHO to negotiate with manufacturers to address market"
"shortages of diagnostic tests and supplies, has secured commitment for five million tests to be procured over the"
next four weeks. WHO continues to look for suppliers who can provide sample collection kits to increase overall
procurement stocks.
Collective UN efforts to source extremely limited supplies of clinical equipment are ongoing. WHO and consortium
"partners have conducted market mapping activities to identify supply sources for oxygen concentrators, ventilators,"
"and other essential equipment for COVID-19 treatment centers. To date, approximately US$400 million in clinical"
"care equipment has been identified from oxygen production, biomedical equipment and accessories manufacturers."
Discussions with private sector partners indicate manufacturers are generally in favour of the COVID-19 Supply Chain
approach to sourcing and allocating supplies. This should bring clarity and transparency to requests for critical
supplies that manufacturers are receiving from around the world.
Sourcing activities for personal protective equipment are ongoing. The first batch of purchases are expected to be
"placed for 75 million masks, 50 million respirators, 28 million gloves and 10 million face shields."
Discussions are ongoing with the Jack Ma Foundation for an additional provision of 100 million surgical masks and
one million respirators.
Technical support for COVID-19 treatment centres
"WHO is supporting Italy’s Bologna and Puglia provinces, helping to design and install COVID-19 treatment centres in"
these provinces’ hospitals.
"In Nigeria, WHO has provided technical guidance for a proposed self-quarantine facility in an internally displaced"
persons (IDP) camp run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
"WHO has also provided support for the installation of COVID-19 treatment facilities in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,"
"Senegal, São Tomé and Príncipe and Australia."

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts,
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further",
,international spread*;,
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;",
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;,
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment",
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;",
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;,
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.,
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",,
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",,
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",,
risk communication.,,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
