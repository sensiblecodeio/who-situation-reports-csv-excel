SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Adapting social media listening to fight the COVID-19 infodemic,
Never before has so much real-time information been,Figure 2: Shifting paradigm in social media listening
collated and shared in the public domain during a public,
health crisis. This is largely due to the rapid growth of,
digital communications and social networking which have,
brought about both positive and negative impacts on,
"society. Today, we are fighting a massive ‘infodemic’– an",
overabundance of false or misleading information on,
"COVID-19, which poses a grave threat to response efforts",
"and public health. At the same time however, new and",
impactful measures to manage the infodemic have been,
identified.,
"The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), in",
"collaboration with research partners, has rapidly built an",
"innovative analysis capability, to run a weekly study using",
"digital media data to identify, understand and categorize",
the key concerns expressed by millions of people online.,
The purpose of this groundbreaking work is to provide,
WHO with curated intelligence to fill information voids,
with solid facts from trusted sources before misleading,
"information becomes viral, causing further damage to",
communities.,
The public perception of misleading or false information,
"often coincides with harmful rumour-spreading posts,",
groups and profiles that are widely spread on social media,
platforms. EPI-WIN’s work in this area therefore focuses,"Source: Tim Zechin, Media Measurement; drawing by Sam Bradd"
"not only on identifying misleading sources, posts and narratives,",
but on identifying or predicting rising areas of concern and information voids.,
"This is made possible by aggregating publicly available social and news media, web analytics as well as online search",
"data, currently in the English language. Data sets are based around a newly developed pandemic public health",
"taxonomy that focuses on four thematic areas: the cause, the illness, the interventions, and the treatment. In",
"addition, a fifth area looks at the type of information shared and meta-conversations on mis- and dis-information.",
"These data, captured at a global level, provide the baseline for the analysis, and are examined by digital consultants",
"to identify the most prevalent thematic areas, and themes that are seeing the highest level of growth. Analysts then",
"detect the pace at which comments on these themes are shared, their networks and potentially threatening sources.",
This systematic approach gives the EPI-WIN team an early warning of the points of concern expressed by the digital,
public.,
"Advanced language analytics are also applied to the data, to measure the presence of emotional language and",
provide insight into how people are discussing topics. These also highlight whether there is a tangible week-on-week,
"shift in emotional language used for each tracked taxonomy. The analysis focuses on emotions (including denial,",
"sadness, anxiety, fear, anger and acceptance), rather than sentiment (positive versus negative). This enables WHO to",
share the types and formats of information needed to address the needs of the public in the most effective way.,
"Weekly insights highlight key topics of concern, including areas demonstrating an increase in the spread of",
"misleading information, how and where that information has been spread, the context behind the spread, and the",
underlying narratives that need to be addressed through reliable information.,
"Applying this methodology to public health has provided invaluable insight, inspiring new ways of thinking and",
communicating risk during health emergencies. This research framework is now being used in Canada in French by,

the Québec National Institute of Public Health (INSPQ) to guide public health communication strategies in the
province. There is now an opportunity to compare the similarities and differences of how this insight can be used at
"the local level, and with the added layer of bilingual search options."
The general approach to analysis was presented at the recent WHO consultation on infodemic management
framework.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,,
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:,,
•,Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts,
,"and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further",
,international spread*;,
•,"Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;",
•,Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;,
•,"Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment",
,"options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;",
•,Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;,
•,Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.,
"*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis",,
"and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in",,
"health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and",,
risk communication.,,
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE,,

•,"WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data",
,"collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to",
,"characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity,",
,"spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of",
,"countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One",
,such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and,
,contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to,
,"gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of",
,"COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health",
,guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC,,
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is,,
"spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that",,
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your,,
"risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your",,
"healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19",,
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take,,
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).,,
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the,,
"advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection",,
"will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people,",,
"and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or",,
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past,,
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).,,
CASE DEFINITIONS,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
document which includes case definitions.,,
"For easy reference, case definitions are included below.",,

Suspect case,,
A.,"A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough,",
,"shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of",
,COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.,
,OR,
B.,A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19,
,case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;,
,OR,
C.,"A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g.,",
,"cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that",
,fully explains the clinical presentation.,
Probable case,,
A.,A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.,
,a.,Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.
,OR,
B.,A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.,
Confirmed case,,
"A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.",,
• Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.,,
Definition of contact,,
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days,,
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:,,
1.,Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;,
2.,Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;,
3.,Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal,
,protective equipment1; OR,
4.,Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.,
"Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days",,
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a,,
"probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to",,
COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here.,,
