Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 108,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 7 May 2020",,
This report has been reformatted to improve accessibility for persons with visual impairment.,,
Highlights,,
"More than 3.5 million cases of COVID-19 and 250,000 deaths have now been reported to WHO.",,
"At yesterday’s media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, referring to the",,
"fact that crises can exacerbate existing inequalities, reiterated that ‘We cannot end the pandemic until",,
we address the inequalities that are fueling it.’ He also highlighted six criteria that WHO recommends,,
countries should take into account when considering the easing of lockdown restrictions.,,
"WHO, UNICEF and the International Federation of the Red Cross have published guidance for countries",,
on how to maintain community-based healthcare in the context of COVID-19 . it complements the,,
United Nations framework for the socio-economic response to COVID-19.,,
WHO and the Delegation of the European Union (EU) have announced a new collaboration in Somalia,,
to strengthen operational response activities for COVID-19.,,
COVID-19 messages are reaching new audiences in Turkey as Goodwill Ambassadors from United,,
Nations agencies in the country share information from WHO with their followers.,,
"In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, WHO lists eight key criteria for the ethical acceptability of COVID-19",,
human challenge studies.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,3 672 238 cases (83 465),254 045 deaths (6539)
Africa,35 470 cases (1497),1228 deaths (23)

Western Pacific,156 184 cases (1300),6361 deaths (34)

Subject in Focus: Key criteria for the ethical acceptability of COVID-19,,
human challenge studies,,
"The widespread use of safe and efficacious vaccines for COVID-19 could save many lives, prevent disease, and",,
permit the safe relaxation of other public health measures. There is thus an urgent ethical imperative for well-,,
designed and carefully conducted research aimed at developing such vaccines and increasing relevant scientific,,
"knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2. Controlled human infection studies, also known as human challenge studies,",,
have been proposed as one means of testing the many vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. In response to the,,
need for ethical guidance to inform policy and decisions regarding the potential development of such research,,
"programmes, WHO has developed key criteria that COVID-19 challenge study programmes would need to meet",,
to ensure that such research is conducted to the highest ethical standards.,,

Table 1. Eight criteria for SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies,,
Scientific and ethical assessments,,
Criterion 1,Scientific justification,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies must have strong
scientific justification"
,,It must be reasonable to expect that the potential
Criterion 2,Assessment of risks and,benefits of SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies
,potential benefits,
,,outweigh risks
Consultation and coordination,,
Criterion 3,Consultation and engagement,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge research programmes
should be informed by consultation and
engagement with the public as well as relevant
experts and policy-makers"
,,SARS-CoV-2 challenge study research
,,programmes should involve close coordination
Criterion 4,Coordination,"between researchers, funders, policy-makers and"
,,regulators
Selection criteria,,
Criterion 5,Site selection,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies should be situated
where the research can be conducted according
to the highest scientific, clinical and ethical
standards"
Criterion 6,Participant selection,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge study researchers
should ensure that participant selection criteria
limit and minimize risk"
Review and consent,,
Criterion 7,Expert review,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies should be reviewed
by a specialized independent committee"
Criterion 8,Informed consent,"SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies must involve
rigorous informed consent"

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
Council resolution 1244 (1999).,
"In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for",
visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases and deaths reported under the international conveyance (Diamond,
Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such reconciliation exercises have taken place. When additional details become,
"available in future which allow the subtractions to be apportioned to previous days, numbers will",
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be retrospectively updated; the most up -to-,
date data can always be found at covid19.who.int,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,

"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata"
The numbers of cases for Ecuador have been revised by national authorities.
