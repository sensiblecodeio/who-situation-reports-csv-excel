Subject in Focus: Smallpox eradication and key lessons for tackling COVID-
19
"“When it comes to epidemic disease, we have a shared responsibility and a shared destiny,”"
"WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus"
8 May 2020 marks the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Smallpox Eradication by the World Health
Assembly. Smallpox claimed more than 300 million lives in the first three -quarters of the 20th century alone and
on average around 4 million deaths each year. It had existed for at least 3000 years and was one of the world’s
"most feared diseases until it was eradicated by a global effort, led by WHO. It is now the only human disease to"
have been eradicated worldwide. How the global community came together at the time to eradicate smallpox
offers important and valuable lessons today in the fight against COVID-19.
"COVID-19 is not the same as smallpox. Smallpox was caused by the variola virus, an orthopoxvirus, transmissible"
"from one person to another by respiratory droplets or direct contact, and a vaccine had been available for over"
"150 years. COVID-19 also passes from person to person and via contact with contaminated surfaces, but there"
"are currently no licenced vaccines available. Regardless, measures and approaches employed to eradicate"
"smallpox, which centred around strong political will, basic field epidemiology and life-saving public health"
"interventions, are equally pertinent today as the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic."
The key public health strategies and the effort at the national level that were critical to succeed at the time
remain at the core of everything we must do to combat COVID-19. These include but are not limited to:
"surveillance, case-finding, contact-tracing, isolation and quarantine where appropriate, building a sense of"
"community ownership, and concerted and accelerated global research and development into vaccines,"
"diagnostics, therapeutics and diagnostics to supplement public health and social measures, and life-saving"
clinical practices.

"Just as it was for smallpox, effective communication to enable people to protect themselves and others, and to"
"find new cases, remains central to outbreak response today. Getting the right information to the right people in"
"the right way at the right time remains absolutely critical – from posters for polio in the 1950s, picture cards for"
"smallpox in the 1970s, large-scale social mobilization for major public health programmes over the last forty"
"years, to clear risk communication and ‘managing the infodemic’ in 2020 to fight misinformation. Rumours have"
"always abounded, even if the way we address them must change in today’s world."
"Nonetheless, these time-tested strategies alone could not have saved humanity from the scourge of smallpox"
were it not for global cooperation and mutual support. This gives us hope that we can achieve the same result in
"a new era. Despite the geopolitical tensions today, just as there were during the Cold War when smallpox was"
"finally eradicated during the 1970s, scientists and public health workers from around the world are working"
together to contain a virulent infection that threatens our health.
The 40th anniversary of the eradication of smallpox is also significant for immunization. The eradication of
"smallpox laid the foundation for immunization programmes worldwide, underpinning the establishment of"
"primary healthcare in many countries. Today, vaccine hesitancy is on the rise and may yet derail the global"
"response to COVID-19 if communication countermeasures are not in place. Vaccines work, and vaccination"
"continues to save up to 3 million lives every year from polio, measles and other infectious and chronic diseases,"
beyond the millions of deaths averted thanks to the discovery and adoption of the smallpox vaccine.
"On 8 May 2020, WHO launched a commemorative smallpox postal stamp to mark this historic achievement in"
public health history. The stamp designed for WHO by the United Nations Postal Administration was unveiled to
"honour our collective legacy, the people who made it possible, and the global solidarity we need today to fight a"
new common threat.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,

cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] Allreferences to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
