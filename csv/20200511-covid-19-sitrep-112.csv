Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 112,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 11 May 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO has published new guidance on Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection. The,,
document provides an overview of surveillance strategies that Member States should consider as part of,,
comprehensive national surveillance for COVID-19. It also emphasise the need to adapt and reinforce,,
existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed.,,
WHO has published new guidance on Contact tracing in the context of COVID-19. When systematically,,
"applied, the guidance will help break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious disease",,
and is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks.,,
"In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’, WHO provides an update on the work of the Emergency Medical Teams,",,
"the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Risk Communication and Community",,
Engagement.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,4 006 257 cases (88 891),278 892 deaths (4531)
Africa,44 533 cases (1907),1415 deaths (46)
Americas,1 702 451 cases (47 073),101 874 deaths (3151)
Eastern Mediterranean,265 164 cases (9436),9013 deaths (135)
Europe,1 731 606 cases (23 660),156 603 deaths (1051)
South-East Asia,100 881 cases (5567),3481 deaths (125)
Western Pacific,160 910 cases (1248),6493 deaths (23)

Subject in Focus: Partner Coordination update
"UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are major partners embedded in the global COVID-19 incident"
"management team in Geneva, and are supporting all pillars of response."
Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs)
One hundred and twenty-seven Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) are ready or getting ready for
deployment.
"To date, a total of 20 EMTs have been internationally deployed to provide support to 16 countries and"
another 37 EMTs are supporting national operations in the response to COVID-19. More than 3600 beds
"have been managed by EMTs and have contributed to increasing national capacity, while 340 different"
training events have been conducted benefitting almost 11 000 front line responders.
"As of 10 May 2020, international operations have significantly increased in the African Region, in Ghana,"
"South Africa, Zambia, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Algeria, Democratic Republic of the"
"Congo, Congo and Zimbabwe. EMTs have also deployed in the European Region notably in Italy where"
"four international EMTs, in addition to two Italian EMTs have contributed to national operations. In"
"addition, EMTs have provided support to Cambodia, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh."
The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)
"GOARN partners and networks are providing technical advice across all health operation pillars,"
"particularly clinical management, infection prevention and control, laboratory and risk communication"
and community engagement (RCCE).
"As of 11 May 2020, 518 offers of support have been received from GOARN partners; and 72 individuals"
have deployed to the field. Operational factors that have a major impact on the deployment of
international support are the heavy restrictions and quarantine requirements related to international air
"transport travel. WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), partners and"
"stakeholders to maximise the potential of existing commercial traffic, and special capacity available for"
COVID-19 operations.
"WHO, GOARN partners, and stakeholders continue to collaborate on the roll-out and implementation of"
Go.Data. Go.Data is a field platform for collecting and analyzing key data for case investigations; for
contact tracing and follow-up; and for generating chains of transmission.
"The Go.Data team has involved staff and consultants in France, Germany, Malta, Switzerland, the US,"
"and Viet Nam. The team has responded to 279 requests from 140 countries and territories, and is"
supporting 53 projects worldwide to implement Go.data. Seventy-two partners have been part of
"briefings, webinars, and trainings, including WHO major offices, ministries of health, hospitals,"
"universities and research centres, technical partners, and networks, NGOs, stakeholders, donors, and the"
private sector.

Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE)
The Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE) partners have published ‘Tips for
"engaging communities during COVID-19 in Low Resource settings’, which is available from the Red Cross"
"Community Engagement Hub, hosted by the British Red Cross."
"UNESCO, UNICEF, the World Bank and WFP have published a Framework for Reopening Schools ,"
"addressing the impact of school-closure on children, specifically the marginalized. It highlights the"
"importance of education and of wellbeing considerations for safe school return, providing advice on"
"core pillars including safe operations, learning, including the most marginalized, wellbeing and"
protection.
Additional information is available on the GOARN knowledge platform for COVID-19 to share
resources from partners and other stakeholders.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of,,,,
complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
"subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior",
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
ii “Territories”,"include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar"
status.,

"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"11 May 2020, Ecuador: There is a large increase in deaths. The Ecuador Ministry of Health"
,"(MoH) explained in a press release today, that the 25% increase in deaths compared to the"
,"previous day, is a result of reclassification of 410 deaths as COVID-19 deaths, after completing"
,clinical-epidemiological investigations. This increased the number of “deceased by COVID-19”
,from 1717 to 2127 deaths as of 10 May 2020.
