Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 113,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 12 May 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO has published a new guidance on Considerations for school-related public health measures in the,,
context of COVID-19 as an annex to earlier guidance on adjusting public health and social measures,,
published on 15 April 2020.,,
WHO has issued a Statement on Tobacco use and COVID-19. Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for,,
many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. A review of studies by,,
public health experts convened by WHO found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease,,
"with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be",,
cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19.,,
"The Director-General Dr. Tedros in his media briefing yesterday, urged a slow, steady, lifting of public",,
"health and social measures (so called lockdowns), which is key to stimulating economies, while also",,
keeping a vigilant eye on the virus so that control measures can be quickly implemented if an upswing in,,
cases is identified.,,
"In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, WHO Operations and Support Logistics (OSL), in collaboration with a",,
"technical network of universities, architects, biomedical engineers and other health experts, is working",,
"to support the establishment of COVID-19 treatment centres, self-quarantine and community facilities at",,
the request of countries seeking technical guidance in setting up such facilities.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,4 088 848 cases (82 591),283 153 deaths (4 261)

Subject in Focus: Technical support for COVID-19 treatment centres
"WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL), in collaboration with a technical network of universities,"
"architects, biomedical engineers and other health experts, is working to support the establishment of COVID-"
"19 treatment centres, self-quarantine and community facilities at the request of countries seeking technical"
guidance in setting up such facilities.
"Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO OSL has provided technical recommendations and"
"operational guidance for the construction of treatment centres, or repurposing of existing buildings, to"
provide medical care to COVID-19 patients.
"To support this initiative, OSL is working to establish a global Technical Network that so far has brought"
"together the expertise of 200 architects, academics, civil engineers, biomedical engineers and other technical"
health experts from 27 institutions across 22 countries. The initiative aims to strengthen national COVID-19
"preparedness and rapid response capacities through a multi-disciplinary collaboration, 24-hour remote"
"support and, whenever required and possible, deployment of international experts to support the COVID-19"
response in countries in need of technical assistance.
"Since March, OSL’s HealthTech Unit, with the voluntary support of architects and engineers from the"
"Technical Network, has helped set up COVID-19 treatment centres in the following countries: Senegal,"
"Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Australia"
and Italy.
"In Tanzania, OSL recently completed the design and layout plan to convert a commercial site in Dar Es Salaam"
into a 500-bed capacity COVID-19 treatment centre. Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and
"colleagues in the WHO Country Office, OSL architects and health experts have provided blueprints and"
technical operational guidance for the facility.
"In Burkina Faso, OSL worked in partnership with the Ministry of Health to set up a 42-bed COVID-19"
treatment centre in Bobo-Dioulasso. The centre is currently functioning and run by Médecins Sans Frontières.
"In Nigeria, OSL has helped set up a COVID-19 Self-Quarantine Facility in a camp for internally displaced"
"persons (IDPs) run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The facility, located next to the"
"camp, aims to provide early recognition and source control, including isolating patients with suspected"
"COVID-19, as a strategy for preventing or limiting transmission in camps and camp-like settings. The facility"
"was designed to allow a safe, controlled, dignified and comfortable self-quarantine for new arrivals in order to"
"(a) limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and"
"healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, strengthening health facilities; (b) identify"
and provide optimised care for infected patients early; and (c) communicate critical risk and information to all
communities and counter misinformation.
"In Italy, OSL is providing technical assistance, working with hospitals in Bologna and in the southern Puglia"
region to advise hospitals on adapting existing care facilities into dedicated treatment facilities for COVID-19
patients.
"To coordinate technical assistance, OSL has established a COVID-19 Help Desk, a 24-hour global resource to"
provide technical information and support to the COVID-19 treatment and healthcare facilities.
Recommendations and solutions provided by the Help Desk are based on WHO guidelines and are adapted to
"the social, economic and health context of each country. The Help Desk works in collaboration with other"
"WHO outbreak response pillars, including the COVID-19 Supply Portal, HealthOPS clinical care, case"
management and other WHO support mechanisms to assist Member States in strengthening response
capacity for managing the COVID-19 outbreak.
Development of a standardized assessment tool for COVID-19 treatment centres is currently ongoing. SARI
"Treatment Centre guidelines are now available in English, French, Portuguese and Italian; translations into"
other UN languages are forthcoming.
Requests for information or support from the COVID-19 Help Desk can be submitted to:

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period,,,,
of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
"subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior",
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
