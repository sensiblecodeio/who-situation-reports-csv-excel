Situation Report – 114,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 13 May 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO has published an annex to the guidance on considerations on adjusting public health and social,,
measures (PHSM). The new annex provides a pragmatic decision process to help countries through,,
adapting PHSM based on epidemiological and public health criteria.,,
"According to the 2020 World Health Statistics published by WHO today, the COVID-19 pandemic is",,
"causing significant loss of life, disrupting livelihoods, and threatening the recent advances in health and",,
progress towards global sustainable development goals.,,
WHO has joined forces with the United Kingdom to run an awareness campaign named “Stop The,,
Spread” about the risks of inaccurate and false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.,,
"The Regional Director for the WHO Regional Office for the Americas, Dr. Carissa F. Etienne called on",,
countries to “support their economies while building strong social protection networks and embracing,,
evidence-based public health measures that are essential to saving lives”.,,
"In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, we discuss newly released WHO guidelines for school-related public",,
health measures.,,

Subject in Focus: Considerations for school-related public health measures
in the context of COVID-19
"Across the globe, countries have implemented a number of control measures to respond to COVID-19,"
"with the objective of slowing down transmission and reducing mortality. Based on local epidemiology,"
"some countries are in the process of scaling up public health and social measures, while others are"
considering or currently scaling down these interventions.
"Based on local risk assessments, countries have implemented several public health and social"
"measures, such as local movement restrictions, adapting schools to distance-learning and businesses"
"to teleworking, and international travel measures. WHO has issued considerations for school-related"
public health measures to guide decision-makers and educators on how or when to reopen or close
"schools in the context of COVID-19. These decisions have important implications for children, parents"
"or caregivers, teachers and other staff, communities, and society at large."
"WHO school-related considerations to decide to close, partially close or reopen schools is guided by a"
"risk-based approach to maximize the educational and health benefit for students, teachers, staff, and"
"the wider community, and help prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19 in the community. A series of"
"factors should be considered when deciding on whether to open or to close schools, such as the"
"epidemiology of COVID-19 nationally and in the local area, health system and public health capacity to"
respond to outbreaks as well as the school settings and ability to maintain COVID-19 prevention and
"control measures that protect children. Thus, additional important factors to include in the assessment"
"are risk of non-return to school, risk of widening disparity in educational attainment, access to meals"
"for children who need them, the possibility of domestic violence aggravated by economic"
"uncertainties, and the need to maintain schools at least partially open for children whose caregivers"
are ‘key workers’ for the country.
"These school-related considerations also provide recommended measures on hygiene, daily practices,"
physical distancing and tele-schooling to guide school reopening. These recommendations are
provided through questions and answers and can be used as a checklist under topics such as: school
resources and infrastructure; policy for educators and school staff; safety and security of the children;
"hygiene and practices at schools; and communication with parents and students. Finally, it is crucial to"
monitor the protective measures implemented to ensure their effectiveness and impact not only on
"educational objectives but also on health and well-being of the children, parents, family and school"
staff.
This risk-based approach needs to be implemented through inclusive and early collaboration between
"the school and the community. During this unique and challenging period, it is important for decision-"
"makers, educational institutions and caregivers to maintain flexibility and modify approaches to"
"ensure learning and sharing of good practices in order to do what is best for the children, students,"
"school staff, and community."
The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) co-hosted a webinar with UNICEF on public
"health and social measures in schools on 13 May, with more than 890 registrants. Key questions such"
"as managing physical distancing, physical activities and wearing of masks still remain as countries"
implement measures over the coming weeks and months. The comments provided by the participants
were very positive and there were requests for a follow up seminar on examples from countries.

(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period,,,,
of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] Allreferences to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
"subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior",
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” includeterritories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
No major updates.,
