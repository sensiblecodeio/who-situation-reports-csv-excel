Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 115,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 14 May 2020",,
Highlights,,
Lesotho reported its first case of COVID-19.,,
WHO has published an interim guidance document on Laboratory biosafety for testing of clinical,,
specimens of patients that meet the case definition of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).,,
"WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros in his media briefing yesterday, highlighted the urgent need for all",,
"countries to invest in strong health systems and primary healthcare, as the best defence against",,
"outbreaks like COVID-19. The World Health Statistics published by WHO, show that people around the",,
world are living longer and healthier lives overall with the biggest gains in low-income countries.,,
"However, the report also shows that the rate of progress is too slow to meet the Sustainable",,
Development Goals and will be further thrown off track by COVID-19.,,
WHO announced the launch of the WHO Academy and the WHO info mobile applications . The WHO,,
Academy app is designed to support health workers during COVID-19 while the WHO Info app will,,
provide the general public with real-time mobile access to the latest news and developments.,,
"In the light of overcrowding in many places of detention, which undermines hygiene, health, safety and",,
"human dignity, UNODC,WHO,UNAIDS and OHCHR released a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons",,
and other closed settings to urgently draw the attention of political leaders to the heightened,,
vulnerability of prisoners and other people deprived of liberty due to COVID-19 pandemic.,,

Subject in Focus: Cleaning and Disinfection of Environmental Surfaces
"Like other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped"
"virus with an outer lipid envelope, which makes it more susceptible to disinfectants compared to non-"
"enveloped viruses such as rotavirus, norovirus, and poliovirus.1The virus that causes COVID-19 is"
"transmitted mainly through close contact and respiratory droplets, with possible airborne transmission"
in settings where procedures that can generate aerosol are performed.2 Although fomites and
"contaminated surfaces have yet to be conclusively linked to transmission of SARS-CoV-2, demonstration"
of surface contamination in healthcare settings3 and experiences with surface contamination linked to
"subsequent infection transmission in other coronaviruses, have informed the development of cleaning"
and disinfection recommendations to mitigate the potential of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
healthcare3 and non-healthcare settings.4
"In healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include the surfaces of furniture and other fixed items (e.g."
"tables, chairs, walls, light switches, computer peripherals) as well as the surfaces of non-critical medical"
"equipment (equipment that only comes into contact with intact skin, such as blood pressure cuffs,"
"wheelchairs, incubators).6 These surfaces should be frequently cleaned with water and detergent and"
followed by application of a disinfectant. Among the most common disinfectants used which have been
"demonstrated to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 are: ethanol 70-90%; chlorine-based products (e.g.,"
hypochlorite) at 0.1% (1000 ppm) for general environmental disinfection or 0.5% (5000 ppm) for blood
and body fluids large spills; or hydrogen peroxide >0.5%.5- 6 The minimal time recommended of exposition
to the surface for these disinfectants is one minute1 or according to the manufacturer instructions.
"In non-healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include furniture and other fixed items, such as"
"counter tops, stairway rails, as well as floors and walls. Disinfectants should be applied to high touch"
surfaces to reduce potential SARS-CoV-2 virus contamination in community settings where the risk of
"contamination is unknown (e.g. gyms, offices, restaurants, accommodation sector) as well as in"
households and non-traditional facilities where individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
disease are accommodated.
"In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to environmental surfaces via spraying or fogging"
(also known as fumigation or misting) is not recommended. Spraying environmental surfaces in both
health care and non-healthcare settings (e.g. patient households) with disinfectants will not be effective
"and may pose harm to individuals.7-10 If disinfectants are to be applied, manual surface cleaning with"
"detergent and water using applied friction (e.g. brushing, scrubbing) must be performed first to ensure"
"physical removal of organic materials, followed by use of a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the"
disinfectant.
"Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces (such as streets, sidewalks, walkways or marketplaces), is not"
recommended to remove or inactivate SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens. Streets and sidewalks are not
"considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Moreover, disinfectants are inactivated by dirt and debris,"
and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces. Even in the
"absence of organic matter, chemical spraying is unlikely to adequately cover all surfaces for the duration"
of the required contact time to inactivate pathogens.
"Spraying individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended"
under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not
reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. The toxic effect of
"spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm"
"due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting.9, 11"
"The role of fomites as a mode of transmission of COVID-19 in general, and the necessity of disinfection"
practices to mitigate transmission of the virus outside of healthcare environments is currently unknown.
"However, infection prevention and control principles designed to mitigate the spread of pathogens in"
"health settings, including cleaning and disinfection practices, have been widely adapted in current"
"guidance to be applied in non-healthcare setting environments.12-21In all settings, including settings"
"where resource limitations may not permit cleaning and disinfection to be performed regularly, frequent"

hand washing and avoiding touching of the face should be considered the primary prevention approach,,,,,
to mitigate the suspected mode of transmission associated with surface contamination.22,,,,,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period,,,,
of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic",
and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
"subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior",
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be",
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through
,"an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories”include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
No major updates.,
