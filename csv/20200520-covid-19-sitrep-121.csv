"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 20 May 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr Carissa F. Etienne highlighted that addressing,,
"COVID-19 will require protecting vulnerable groups including women, underprivileged",,
"populations, indigenous populations and migrants, by addressing health, social and economic",,
inequalities.,,
WHO has published a new Case Report Form for “Suspected cases of multisystem,,
inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19”,,
intended for use by public health professionals for collecting standardized data on clinical,,
"presentations, severity and outcomes.",,
Uganda commissioned the first Port Health COVID-19 laboratory at the main Uganda-,,
Tanzania border in light of potential COVID-19 importation by truck drivers. Two GeneXpert,,
"machines will be used to test all truck drivers arriving at the Mutukula point of entry, where",,
results will become available within 45 minutes.,,
"A doctor from Cairo, Egypt describes how he became infected with and recovered from COVID-",,
"19 and highlights the need for health care workers to practise basic infection, prevention and",,
control measures when interacting with patients.,,
Evidence from social science can help officials develop and implement policies in ways that are,,
"more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs. In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, we",,
look at how WHO is implementing the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda to translate,,
evidence from the social sciences into action.,,

Subject in Focus: Infodemics Management - Social science
evidence in outbreak response
"To tackle the health, social and economic challenges of COVID-19, decision-makers need data and"
research from many different disciplines. At the Global Research and Innovation meeting held in Geneva
"on 11-12 February 2020, over 400 scientists, Member State representatives, public health professionals,"
donors and private sector representatives came together to agree on priorities to accelerate research for
the COVID-19 response. Social science was one of the nine research areas that featured on the
meeting’s agenda.
"Social science is a broad disciplinary field that includes anthropology, psychology, behavioural science,"
"political science, and social epidemiology. Evidence from social science can help officials develop and"
implement policies in ways that are more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs and to
"the realities of where and how people live, think and act, as individuals and as a group."
A technical working group of social scientists across the world’s regions was convened to guide and
support further development of the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda.1 The aim of this group is to
translate evidence from the social sciences into action that can inform response strategies by developing
"and sharing protocols, tools and technical expertise, for example on key considerations from social"
"science on public use of face masks, immunity passports, homecare, routine immunization programmes,"
and vaccine implementation. The group achieves its objectives through collaboration and by coordinating
"action with other initiatives, including with the research arm of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response"
Network (GOARN).
The COVID-19 Research Roadmap highlighted the need for social science research in three priority
areas:
"First, research about the impacts of COVID-19 and the public health response, including secondary"
"impacts, will help countries at different phases of the response to learn from others. This is key to"
"informing and tailoring local and national responses. For example, research on how public health lock-"
down measures have affected mental health and household incomes can help officials plan how best to
"support communities once these measures are lifted. Under the COVID-19 Research Roadmap, a"
research group in China is studying the lessons learned following the public health measures taken in
that country.
"Second, research on health systems and models of care in different regions will enable adaptation and"
efficiencies specific to the COVID-19 health care response. Research in this area can help officials plan
best approaches for managing patient flows and also provide the right support to those providing care in
formal and informal community settings. A review of different models of homecare is currently underway
to identify and share best methods for low resource settings. Working with infection prevention and
"control experts, a research protocol guidance document and data collection tools have also been"
developed to study the views of health workers on infection prevention and control procedures and on
their well-being. Research groups in different regions are implementing this study and are meeting
"regularly to share experiences, results and learning."
"Third, research on the flows of information, misinformation and disinformation, and on effective"
"approaches for addressing stigma, will help science-based information and recommendations reach"
intended audiences. Data-driven insights can help officials tackle the infodemic and implement strategies

"to build trust. Across all these areas, there is an essential need to define and prioritize vulnerable"
populations so that evidence can inform policy development which accounts for and meets their needs.
The working group continues to collaborate with colleagues working on different technical areas and
"groups: immunization, ethics, gender, maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, to name"
a few; informing social science evidence in the work of WHO.
A toolbox on good participatory practice for COVID-19 clinical trials and on working with Community
Advisory Boards for COVID-19 related clinical studies is also now available.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus,,,,
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of,,,,
death is available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken,
"to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change.",
"Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented,",
"with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting",
these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the",
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any,
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or",
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which,
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the",
administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that,
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that,
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are",
distinguished by initial capital letters.,
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations,
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo",
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.",
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case",
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and",
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases.",
Other*: includes cases reported from an international conveyance (Diamond Princess).,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove,
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as",
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid,
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available,
"that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be",
updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the,
most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes",
"available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission",
may be present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table).
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.

"ii“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
Additional figure notes,
"The decrease in cases shown today in Figure 2 should be interpreted with caution, as updated",
case counts are temporarily not available for several countries with large numbers of cases,
(see Table 1 for specifics).,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update 20 May 2020, United States of America: Counts adjusted retrospectively by"
