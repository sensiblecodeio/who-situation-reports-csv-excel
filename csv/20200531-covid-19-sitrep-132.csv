Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with,,,,
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a,,,,
"clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is",,,,
a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g.,,,,
trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and,,,,
death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of,,,,
death is available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-"
"off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are"
"subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing"
"strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas."
"These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable"
"underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting"
these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal
"status of any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the"
delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent
"approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,"
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not
imply that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a
"similar nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of"
proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of"
"Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization"
purposes.
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates"
"and errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which,
"remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now",
display such data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns,
as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur.,
When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably,
"apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation",
reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-,
"reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new",
"information becomes available, and are based on the highest category reported.",
Differing degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas .,
Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location"
,and/or by common exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission
,"defined through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large"
,numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases
,from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas
,of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions",
of similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
"No new updates/errata. For previous information, see the log of major changes",
and errata in WHO daily aggregate case and death count data.,
