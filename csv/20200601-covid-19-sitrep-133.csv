Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 133,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 01 June 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO has published a case report form for suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory,,
syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19,,
"During the last two weeks, WHO has delivered over 55 tons of health supplies by road to",,
northeast Syria. These shipments contained equipment and medical supplies to treat,,
"many diseases, including COVID-19.",,
“Clean hands save lives” and “Applaud healthcare workers” campaigns celebrated in,,
"North Macedonia. Midwives and nurses were honored with applause, as over 500",,
healthcare professionals were awarded the “Clean hands” certificate of recognition by,,
WHO.,,
"Since the start of the pandemic, there has been an urgent need to accelerate the research",,
and development of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. WHO has been supporting this effort.,,
Currently over 120 candidate vaccines have been mapped and sites in 40 countries have,,
"expressed an interest to join the Vaccine Solidarity Trial. For more on this, see the ‘Subject",,
in Focus’ below.,,

Subject in Focus: Accelerating Research for the development of a,
Vaccine against COVID-19,
"Since the start of the pandemic, there has been an urgent need to accelerate the research and",
development of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. Under the umbrella of the Global Research,
"Roadmap, the WHO Working Group for Vaccine Prioritization was constituted under the",
leadership of the R&D Blueprint team. This working group provides guidance to vaccine,
developers from a public health perspective and prioritizes vaccine development options,
vaccine platform approaches and/or candidates to be considered for further development and,
potentially considered for late-stage evaluation in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic.,
"In the past three months, since its creation following the Global Research and Innovation forum",
"hosted by WHO on 11-12 February, important progress has been achieved including:",
•,Continuously landscaping and mapping candidate vaccines and their progress across the
,"world. Currently, over 120 candidate vaccines have been mapped, raising the question of"
,how to prioritize the ones that will go from early to later development (from phase I to
,phase 2b/3 clinical trials).
•,"Developing specific criteria that vaccine scientists, product developers, manufacturers,"
,regulators and funding agencies can use for prioritization.
•,"Outlining the desired characteristics for safe and effective vaccines, published in the WHO"
,Target Product Profiles (TPP) for COVID-19 vaccines. The TPP outlines the preferred and
,minimally acceptable profiles for a human COVID-19 vaccine for long-term protection of
,"persons at high ongoing risk of COVID-19, such as healthcare workers, and for reactive use"
,in outbreak settings with rapid onset of immunity to guide vaccine development.
•,Developing a core protocol for a globally coordinated randomized controlled clinical trial for
,vaccines. Recognizing the critical importance to world health of the rapid availability and
,"deployment of effective vaccines against COVID-19, on 9 April WHO published the core"
,"protocol for an international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial that"
,will enable the concurrent evaluation of benefits and risks of each promising candidate
,vaccine within 3–6 months of it being made available for the trial.
•,Launching a call for expressions of interest from vaccine trial sites around the world using
,"the core protocol, which will include several candidate COVID-19 vaccines that meet WHO"
,prioritization criteria. This will prepare for the launch of a Solidarity Trial for Vaccines that
,will build on the platform launched for the Therapeutics Solidarity Trial (see Situation Report
,"119) and lessons learned. Currently, over 150 sites in more than 40 countries have expressed"
,an interest in joining a Vaccine Solidarity Trial.
•,Launching a call for interest in engaging on animal studies for vaccine evaluations with 17
,laboratories in 8 countries with animal laboratory facilities.

•,"Establishing an Expert Group focusing on COVID-19 viruses, reagents and immune assays."
,The goal of the group is to advance the development of COVID-19 medical countermeasures
,(vaccines and immunotherapeutic). This is being achieved by providing a platform to discuss
,"availability of viruses and key reagents, to share data on immune assays and the potential"
,for cross reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses.
•,Establishing an Expert Group focusing on COVID-19 disease modelling and animal models
,that would replicate human COVID-19 with the goal of accelerating testing of vaccines and
,therapeutics. WHO provides a pre-clinical model forum to share information and prevent
,unnecessary repetition of effort.
•,"Coordinating the Human Challenge Studies Working Group, tasked with consider the"
,"feasibility, utility, realistic timelines and approximate costs for establishing a closely"
,monitored experimental challenge model of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (fully virulent or
,attenuated) in healthy adult volunteers. The Expert Group will also discuss the procedures
,to be codified and logistical obstacles to be overcome to perform such challenge studies
,and to propose practical solutions to overcome identified hurdles.

disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,"
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These"
"factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation"
"of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate
"border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and"
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia"
"and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which
"remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display"
such data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as
appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When
additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably
"apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation"
