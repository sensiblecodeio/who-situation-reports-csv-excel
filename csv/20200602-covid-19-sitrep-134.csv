Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 134,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 02 June 2020",,
Highlights,,
"During the 1 June media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted that the",,
COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in services for treatment of non-communicable,,
diseases in many countries. The COVID-19 response must be inclusive of the healthcare needs,,
of people living with these diseases.,,
"WHO has published a new operational guidance on maintaining essential health services,",,
"which provides recommendations for practical actions that countries can take at national, sub-",,
"regional and local levels to reorganize and safely maintain access to high-quality, essential",,
health services during the pandemic.,,
Transporting COVID-19 medical supplies to those in need requires timely decision-making and,,
trouble-shooting skills. The Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean document a week in,,
the life of logistics expert coordinating massive shipments of medical supplies to Yemen.,,
WHO’s support to countries in securing medical products for COVID-19 treatment is,,
highlighted in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,

Subject in Focus: WHO assists vulnerable countries in securing,
medical oxygen products for COVID-19 treatment,
WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) is engaged in discussions with oxygen,
manufacturers and private sector stakeholders through the Pandemic Supply Chain Network,
(PSCN) – an informal network of companies in the private sector that are collaborating with,
WHO to provide market insight and facilitate communications with the private sector to gain,
access to medical products for the COVID-19 response.,
Amidst an acute global shortage of oxygen therapy supplies required for severe cases of,
"COVID-19, WHO’s OSL team is also working through a bio-medical purchasing consortium to",
assist the most vulnerable countries with underfunded health systems in accessing the,
market for medical oxygen.,
Ongoing talks with suppliers in recent weeks have enabled WHO to procure 4000 oxygen,
"concentrators, which are a key component in critical care for patients with severe cases of",
COVID-19. The first batch of 2000 has arrived in a WFP warehouse in Shenzhen and will be,
"shipped to 41 countries, pending customs clearance and shipping documentation.",
"In addition to this initial procurement, an additional 10 000 concentrators and 9820 pulse",
"oximeters were been purchased on 29 May, and will be distributed to more than 120",
countries.,
"WHO, in collaboration with WFP and the Government of Ghana, is engaging with oxygen",
producers to equip a 68-bed field hospital in Accra scheduled for completion on 4 June to,
provide COVID-19 treatment and medical evacuation services.,
"WHO is engaged with additional oxygen support initiatives, including:",
▪,Providing technical guidance and validation to three PSA oxygen generator plants to
,Somalia.
▪,Providing technical guidance and potential procurement of PSA oxygen generator
,plant and oxygen cylinders for South Sudan.
▪,Collaborating with UNICEF Sierra Leone on the design and procurement of three PSA
,oxygen generator plants for health facilities in rural areas of Sierra Leone.
WHO has launched on OpenWHO a Clinical Care Training course for the management of,
patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). More than 100 000 people have,
"enrolled for the training course, currently available in eight languages.",

WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus,,,,
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,"
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These"
"factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation"
"of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate
"border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and"
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia"
"and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which
"remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display"
such data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as
appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When
additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably
"apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation"
reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-,
"reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new",
"information becomes available, and are based on the highest category reported.",
Differing degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas.,
Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or"
,by common exposures.
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission
,"defined through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large"
,numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from
,sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the
,country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions",
of similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update 2 June 2020, United States: Reporting systems were adjusted to provide more"
,"timely updates. Prior to 1 June, case and death counts reflected data published by the"
,"US Centers for Disease Control from two days prior. From 2 June onward, data reflect"
,counts published one day prior. Cumulative counts for 31 May (not otherwise
,published) included 1 757 522 cases and 103 554 deaths. Data were adjusted
,retrospectively to better align with national authorities and are reflected on the WHO
,COVID-19 Dashboard.
