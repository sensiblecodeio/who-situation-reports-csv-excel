Subject in Focus: Returning to work in the context of COVID-19
"On 29 May 2020, WHO and the International Labour Organization (ILO) hosted a webinar on “returning to"
work” in the context of COVID-19 The webinar focused on how businesses and societies can adapt to ensure
"the safety of workers, their families and communities, and the sustainability of business operations as"
national restrictions are eased. It was attended remotely by over 1000 participants from across all six WHO
Regions.
"As businesses are restarted, workers and employees must confront a range of occupational safety and health"
"hazards not limited to the risk of COVID-19 transmission, including psychosocial risks related to fear, stigma"
"and job insecurity. Safety measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 will be necessary, ranging from"
"enhanced hygiene and physical distancing, to mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in"
higher-risk settings where measures based on prevention of exposure cannot sufficiently reduce risk. Risk
"mitigation measures must reflect the features of, and risks related to, each specific job. To ensure they can"
"be properly implemented and are working as intended, individual businesses must develop prevention and"
mitigation action plans in consultation with workers and their representative s based on assessment of
occupational health risks and epidemiological situation; return to work should take place in a phased and
controlled manner; sufficient resources must be put in place; and policies should be revisited and adapted as
the situation changes.
Existing labour standards provide a normative framework for countries and employers to develop policies
and guidance. Many of the issues raised by COVID-19 are already covered in a general manner by ILO
conventions and recommendations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation 164 and
Occupational Safety and Health Convention C155 which provide an overall framework for managing hazards
"in the workplace, in addition to sector-specific labour standards."
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO and the ILO have been working to meet the demand from"
stakeholders for reliable information to inform safe back-to-work strategies. The ILO has also launched a
"portal which brings together the latest news and recommendations related to COVID-19, including specific"
guidance for different sectors. The ILO’s recently-released guidance note on safe and healthy return to work
"aims to assist governments, as well as employers’ and workers’ organizations, in developing national policy"
"guidance for a phased and safe return to work, and provide guidelines for workplace -level risk assessments"
and implementation of preventive and protective measures—which are summarized in the ILO’s ten action
points tool. WHO has produced a scientific brief on modes of transmission of COVID-19.
The Department of Health from South Africa shared current policy perspectives on easing restrictions and
restarting the economy; touching upon many of the issues raised by the other speakers. Despite the
"continuing risk of COVID-19 transmission, the South African government recognised that the current policy of"
lockdowns and closure of businesses is not viable in the long term. To balance the two priorities of
preventing a new wave of COVID-19 cases that could overwhelm the health system and safeguarding
"livelihoods, the government has adopted a phased approach to reopening with five alert levels, tailored to"
"different provinces of the country, with different public health measures and restrictions on activities based"
"on the current risk of COVID-19 transmission. Different sectors, including mining and the public sector, have"
"been given guidelines for return to work at each alert level, along with restrictions that should remain after"
"the lockdown, regardless of the alert level. Activity will be resumed in each sector using a phased approach,"
"with no more than one third of workers returning to work at once. At the same time, safety measures will"
"account for risks to workers as they commute, work, and interact with clients, consumers and the wider"
community. These efforts must be supported by the timely availability of high-quality data to identify
"potential cases, and inspections of workplaces to ensure measures are being implemented."

Social partners on the webinar emphasized that every worker is essential and must be protected from
"COVID-19, and that safe and healthy work conditions are a fundamental right. In the context of the COVID-19"
"pandemic, enhancing workplace safety is not just a concern for individual workers, but is vital to overall"
"public health. The risks faced by workers do not just depend on their job role, but also on the type of"
relationship between workers and their employers. Policy-makers and businesses are called on to pay
"particular attention to protecting contract workers, migrant workers, and those in the informal economy."
"Return to work must also be accompanied by ‘social protection’ measures, particularly paid sick leave and"
"protection against discrimination and harassment, to ensure no group of workers is unfairly disadvantaged."
"As the world economy restarts and begins its recovery, the opportunity to take stock of lessons presented by"
"the pandemic on the relationship between work, human health and environmental sustainability should not"
"be lost. For its part, WHO has developed a manifesto for a healthy and green recovery from COVID-19, with"
"six prescriptions including protecting nature, investing in essential services, ensuring a quick healthy energy"
"transition, promoting healthy and sustainable food systems, building healthy, liveable cities, and ending"
taxpayer subsidies for polluting activities.

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible,,,,
"illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that",,,,
cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery,,,,
between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available,,,,

Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,

"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999)",
have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate . This will aid readers in identifying,
when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to,
"be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports",
will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes available,",
and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be present,
within countries/territories/areas. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update 3 June 2020, France: Counts were retrospectively adjusted by national authorities: 840"
cases were excluded,
