Subject in Focus: Take-off: Guidance for Air Travel through the COVID-19 Public
Health Crisis
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global air transport. The International Civil Aviation
"Organization (ICAO) estimates that global passenger traffic at airports will decrease by 50 per cent in 2020,"
compared to 2019 figures - with up to 71 per cent reduced seat capacity and up to 1.5 billion fewer
"passengers globally. According to ICAO, airlines and airports face a potential loss of revenue of up to US$ 314"
"billion and US$ 100 billion respectively, for 2020."
ICAO’s Council Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) was established on 9 March 2020 to address the
"challenges of COVID-19 and to provide global guidance for a safe, secure and sustainable restart and"
recovery of the aviation sector. This task force is composed of representatives from Member States and
"international, regional and industry organizations, including WHO and the World Tourism Organization"
(UNWTO).
The task force has recently published ‘Take-off: Guidance for Air Travel through the COVID-19 Public Health
"Crisis’, a document that lays out a set of measures aimed at reducing health risks to air travellers, aviation"
"workers, and the general public."
The document provides a framework for addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global
aviation transportation system and is divided in two sections.
"The first section contains risk mitigation measures that apply generally to air passenger and cargo transport,"
"such as: public education, physical distancing, face covering and masks, routine sanitation, health screening,"
"contact tracing, health declarations and testing."
"The second section describes, in four operational modules, the risk mitigation measures applicable to airport,"
"aircraft, crew and cargo."
"When implementing these measures, care should be taken to follow all applicable laws, regulations,"
"requirements, standards, and guidance issued by relevant sub-national, national and international"
authorities. Nothing in these guidelines is intended to supersede or contradict such requirements.
ICAO endorses a phased approach to make possible the safe return to high-volume domestic and
international air travel for passengers and cargo. Risk-based stages for mitigation measures will also
"contribute to the efficient, safe, secure, and sustainable transport by air of an increasing number of"
passengers and cargo.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease,,,,
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible,,,,
"illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that",,,,
cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery,,,,
between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using",
different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy,
"and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions,",
"testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These",
"factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case",
"and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level.",
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not,
"mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by",
initial capital letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999)",
have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate . This will aid readers in identifying,
when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to,
"be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports",
will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting.,
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, and may be revised as new information becomes",
available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas;,
classification is based on the highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected."
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures.

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
