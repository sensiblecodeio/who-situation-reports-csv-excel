Subject in Focus: Key planning recommendations for mass,
gatherings in the context of COVID-19,
WHO has published an updated interim guidance on Key planning recommendations for mass,
gatherings in the context of COVID-19 on 29 May 2020. This general guidance is an updated,
version of the guidance first published on 14 February and revised on 19 March 2020. The current,
version reflects the evolution of the pandemic and the most recent WHO recommendations on,
COVID-19.,
"The guidance provides advice to host governments, health authorities and event organizers on",
"containing COVID-19 risks associated with a mass gathering, and on mitigating the resulting",
likelihood of strain on health services.,
Mass gatherings include a wide range of events characterized by the concentration of people in,
"space and time. They are not merely recreational events; rather, they may also have major political,",
"cultural, social and economic implications. WHO recommends that any decision to restrict, modify,",
"postpone, cancel or proceed with a mass gathering should be based on a rigorous risk assessment,",
based on three main considerations:,
1.,Normative and epidemiological context in which the event takes place: the application of
,"restrictive public health and social measures to control the spread of COVID-19, may not"
,"allow mass gatherings to take place. However, in countries where measures are eased in"
,"response to an evolving transmission scenario, the decision to proceed with an event and"
,"how to proceed, becomes relevant. The context continuously evolves, which entails an"
,"evolution of risk and of the action required to mitigate it, and therefore calls for a review of the"
,risk assessment at regular intervals.
2.,Risk factors associated with the event: this evaluation examines factors which determine the
,"risk profile for an event, including the characteristics of the venue, the number and key"
,"features of the participants (and their expected interactions), the duration of the event, and"
,"the capacity of the health system to detect and manage COVID-19 cases, among others."
3.,"Prevention and control measures: this area focuses on the capacity that host governments,"
,health authorities and event organizers have to apply actions that mitigate the risk identified
,"in step 2, above. Measures may modify the characteristics of the event (venue, attendees,"
,"facilities, etc.) or focus on strengthening the preparedness and response. Prevention and"
,"control measures can be applied throughout the event’s timeline – in the planning phase,"
,"operational phase, and post-event phase."
WHO has developed tools that facilitate the evaluation of the risks associated with a mass gathering,
and guide the selection of tailored prevention and control measures. A set of three tools is currently,
"available: a generic tool, one tailored to sports events, and one tailored to religious events. At the",
"same time, many organisers have adapted and tailored WHO tools to specific purposes, especially",
"for sport-related events, such as football, rugby and rowing competitions – with the aim of guiding",
the decision-making process on closing down or reopening them.,
A mass gathering indicator has been included in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and,
Response Plan (SPRP) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. This will help monitor how health,
systems prepare and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as how they tackle risks,
associated with mass gatherings.,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other"
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken
"to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change."
"Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between"
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented,"
"with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting"
these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available
"that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be"
updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
"Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, and may be revised as new information"
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a
country/territory/area. Categories:
• No cases: with no confirmed cases
