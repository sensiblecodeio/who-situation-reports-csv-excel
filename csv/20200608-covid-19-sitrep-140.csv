Subject in Focus: Partner coordination update,
Health Cluster partners continue to support implementation of the Global Humanitarian,
"Response Plan for COVID-19 in 29 countries experiencing humanitarian crises, affecting 63",
million people. Activities include increasing community awareness of COVID-19 signs and,
"symptoms, related risk factors, the importance of seeking early treatment, and protection",
measures including isolation and quarantine; supporting community-based surveillance and,
points of entry screening; and establishing treatment centres and training health workers in,
COVID-19 case management protocols. To maintain other essential health services (including,
"childhood immunization, maternal and newborn care, and supporting survivors of gender-",
based violence) partners are adapting existing service delivery models and collaborating with,
other health-promoting sectors to ensure safe access and mitigate the socio-economic impact,
of COVID-19. More information can be found on the Global Health Cluster website.,
WHO continues to facilitate direct and remote technical assistance to countries through GOARN,
regional and global networks. All Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN),
partners are involved in national responses to the pandemic. Partners have made 568,
"individual offers of international support, and to date, there have been 79 international",
deployments. Eighteen experts are currently deployed in the field or providing support,
"remotely to countries and WHO. Twelve deployments are currently in process, including for",
assessment and response teams.,
"GOARN partners are providing support in epidemiology, surveillance, laboratory, infection",
"prevention and control (IPC), case management, risk communications and community",
"engagement, and in operational coordination. However, restrictions in international travel, and",
"health and safety requirements, remain major constraints on international deployments to all",
countries.,
"UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United",
"States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United Nations Office for the",
"Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) continue to work closely with WHO, embedded in",
the global COVID-19 incident management team and supporting all pillars of the response.,
"Weekly coordination with GOARN partners ensures updates on developments of the pandemic,",
and on current operations and priorities by WHO and partners. The GOARN COVID-19,
Knowledge Hub facilitates sharing of resources by partners and other stakeholders.,
"IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO, with GOARN support, are strengthening coordination and",
collaboration among key stakeholders at the global and regional levels in risk communications,
and community engagement (RCCE). This includes:,
•,Ongoing weekly collaboration with partners and regional focal points to ensure alignment
,on response priorities and actions; with deep-dive sessions on topics of special interest to
,partners being held bi-weekly;
•,A current focus on adapting global RCCE strategy to current outbreak scenarios and
,defining workplans for the months ahead;
•,"Thematic workgroups on priority topics, including migrants and refugees, operational social"
,"sciences, and RCCE in low resource settings. An additional focus is on establishing"
,monitoring and evaluation indicators and a dashboard for easy access to data amongst
,partners.
"WHO, Esri, the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research",
"Centre (GA-CDRC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and GIS",

Corps are working together to increase GIS technical capacity of GOARN partners for the
COVID-19 pandemic and other future outbreaks.
GOARN partners are collaborating on the development of a new online contact tracing training
"“Social determinants of health in culture in contact tracing”, jointly led by the Australian and"
Canadian Field Epidemiology Training Programmes. Partners are also developing short virtual
GOARN Outbreak Response Leadership training on “sense-making” and “decision-making” for
COVID-19 responders.
"From 9 through 11 June, WHO will convene an online consultation to share practical technical"
"and operational experience on contact tracing activities for COVID-19, including innovations in"
"digital technology, training, and use of Go.Data and other tools. The aim is to identify practical"
opportunities for stakeholders and partners to build capacity through both traditional and
innovative contact tracing approaches. WHO and partners are continuing to support the rollout
and use of Go.Data to assist the urgent scale up of contact tracing capacity.
"As of 7 June 2020, the Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) network has deployed 23 international"
"EMTs to the most affected areas mainly in Europe and Africa. A further 43 national teams, in the"
"process of international classification, have been mobilized to support national health system"
surge capacity. Over 500 national teams have used the EMT methodology to respond to the
COVID-19 crisis.
"On 29 May 2020, the EMT Strategic Advisory Group was convened, where the EMT Secretariat"
"reported the management of more than 10 000 beds, and 400 trainings with over 11 000 front"
line responders trained across all six WHO Regions.
"EMT senior experts have been deployed to oversee the management of operations in Accra,"
"Ghana and Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh as surge to support the respective WHO Country Offices,"
Ministries of Health and partners to improve the coordination and provision of appropriate care
to COVID-19 patients.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,"
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These"
"factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation"
"of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate
"border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and"
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which
"remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display"
such data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as
appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When
additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably
"apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation"
reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.
