Highlights,,
"The WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, has",,
released a statement on the status of the pandemic in the Region. He warns that cases in the,,
region have increased during the past three weeks and there is the risk cases will continue to,,
increase as many countries ease restrictions. He reiterated that every country’s best defense,,
"against COVID-19 is to find, isolate, test and care for every case and to trace and quarantine",,
every contact.,,
"Somalia is expanding its Early Warning, Alert and Response Network (EWARN) across the",,
country to facilitate early detection of suspected cases of COVID-19. WHO will be supporting the,,
roll out of the EWARN system to an additional 230 health centres beyond the current 533,,
"reporting sites, with COVID-19 now being a reportable health condition in Somalia.",,
"In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below, we present interim guidance on the use of masks in the",,
context of COVID-19.,,

Subject in Focus: Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-
19 Interim guidance published 05 June 2020
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on 5 June
"2020, replacing the previous guidance originally published on 6 April 2020."
WHO continues to advise that masks be used as part of a comprehensive package of prevention
and control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. WHO reiterates that the use of a mask
"alone is insufficient to protect the user or others, and other community and personal protection"
measures should also be adopted to suppress spread of COVID-19.
"Within the updated guidance, WHO provides practical advice to decision-makers as to who"
"needs to wear a mask, which type of mask should be used and when it should be worn. It also"
incorporates new research findings since the previous version. The updated guidance
"reinforces the use of a risk-based approach to understand the situation for each country, and"
how masks can be used as part of a comprehensive package of measures to limit the spread of
the virus.
Here is a snapshot of what’s included in the updated guidance:
Advice for use of masks in health settings (including long-term care and residential facilities)
"In care settings where health workers provide direct care to COVID-19 patients, WHO continues"
to recommend the use of a medical mask in addition to other personal protective equipment
"(PPE) that are part of droplet/contact precautions (gown, gloves, eye protection), in the absence"
of aerosol generating procedures (AGP’s). In care settings for COVID-19 patients where AGPs
"are performed, health workers should wear a fit-tested respirator, as part of airborne"
precautions.
"For areas with community transmission of COVID-19, WHO provides new guidance for the"
"targeted continuous use of medical masks for health workers, including caregivers, working in"
clinical areas. This means that health workers should wear a medical mask during their routine
"activities throughout the entire shift, apart from when eating and drinking and changing their"
medical mask after caring for a patient who requires droplet/contact precautions for other
reasons.
The use of non-medical masks (fabric masks) is not considered appropriate protection for
"health workers. In the context of a severe medical mask shortage, face shields may be"
considered as an alternative. Community health workers should wear a medical mask when
providing routine services in areas of community transmission in addition to adhering to
"standard precautions, including physical distancing measures and hand hygiene."

Advice for the general public
"WHO continues to recommend that a person with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, even if"
"symptoms are mild, should wear a medical mask (and seek medical attention). In areas where"
"COVID-19 is widespread, WHO advises governments to encourage the use of medical masks"
"among vulnerable populations: people aged 60 years and older, and those with underlying"
comorbidities.
While many countries are recommending the use of non-medical masks (fabric masks) for the
"general public, this is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence and there"
are potential benefits and harms to consider. WHO has taken into consideration the available
"studies evaluating the potential for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission,"
"individual values and preferences, as well as the difficulty in implementing many public health"
"and social measures, including maintaining physical distancing of at least 1 metre in many"
"contexts, and has updated our guidance. WHO advises governments to encourage the use of"
fabric masks for the general public in areas of widespread transmission in settings where 1m
"physical distance cannot be maintained, and as part of a comprehensive approach to reduce"
transmission. WHO continues to support and advise decision makers on how to apply a risk-
based approach when considering the use of masks for the general public.
The criteria and examples of recommended mask usage in various contexts are provided in the
guidance.
"Finally, the guidance includes new research findings on features to consider when making a"
"fabric mask, including the materials, number of layers, combination of materials, and shape."
"Proper usage, maintenance and management of masks is explained and is essential to ensure"
safety of the wearer. This is the result of research that WHO requested to better understand
how non-medical masks could be used in the context of COVID-19. All scientific references are
included in the guidance document.

and-how-to-use-masks.
"This site also includes FAQs on mask usage, downloadable posters on do’s and don’ts for both"
"medical and non-medical masks, and two videos with a technical expert: one on how to put on"
"and maintain a medical mask, and the other on how to do the same with a fabric mask (using"
the 3-layer composition identified by the research).

A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.

"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
