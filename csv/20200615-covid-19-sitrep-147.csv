(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 147,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 15 June 2020",,
Highlights,,
"As the pandemic accelerates in low- and middle-income countries, WHO is especially concerned about",,
"its impact on people who already struggle to access health services – often women, children and",,
adolescents. WHO has developed guidance on maintaining essential services.,,
WHO has also carefully investigated the risks of women transmitting COVID-19 to their babies during,,
"breastfeeding. Based on the available evidence, WHO’s advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding",,
outweigh any potential risks of transmission of COVID-19. A Q and A on breastfeeding and COVID-19 is,,
also available.,,
WHO has recently released a photo story outlining ten actions you can take to protect and improve your,,
"sexual and reproductive health during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, there is no evidence of",,
"sexual transmission of the virus responsible for COVID-19. The virus can be passed however, through",,
"direct contact with saliva, for instance, kissing.",,
"There are also many things people can do to take care of their own health, like staying active, eating a",,
nutritious diet and limiting their alcohol intake.,,
"In today’s Subject in Focus, we look at the Solidarity Trials, which are being used to accelerate research",,
on a COVID-19 Vaccine.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,7 823 289 cases (132 581),431 541 deaths (3 911)
Africa,175 503 cases (7 937),4 111 deaths (113)
Americas,3 781 538 cases (69 770),201 848 deaths (2 596)
Eastern Mediterranean,778 200 cases (19 649),17 077 deaths (437)
Europe,2 416 920 cases (18 141),188 350 deaths (349)
South-East Asia,471 392 cases (15 953),12 927 deaths (401)
Western Pacific,198 995 cases (1 131),7 215 deaths (15)

Subject in Focus: Accelerating research on a COVID-19 Vaccine,,
"Since the start of the pandemic, there has been an urgent need to accelerate the research and development",,
of a safe and effective vaccine.,,
"To facilitate research and vaccine development, WHO’s R&D Blueprint team convened:",,
1.,"A process to develop a core clinical trial study protocol for a global, and globally coordinated , clinical trial",
,"for vaccines. The idea is to accelerate research on COVID-19 vaccines through a large, international,",
,"randomized controlled clinical trial using a standardized study protocol that enables the agile,",
,simultaneous evaluation of the benefits and risks of multiple candidate vaccines in sites with sufficient,
,COVID-19 attack rates.,
,"To date, more than 120 different candidate vaccines are under development and could be available or",
,"suitable to enter the trial at different times. The aim of the Solidarity Trial, is to quickly enrol and",
,individually randomize very large numbers of adult participants in many different populations and settings,
,across the world. By using a shared placebo/control group and a common core study protocol to evaluate,
,"multiple candidate vaccines in the trial, resources allocated to the evaluation of each candidate vaccine",
,can be saved while ensuring a high standard of scientific rigor and efficiency.,
,"Following an in-depth review by experts and various consultations, a revi sed version of the WHO core",
,"protocol was recently published. In addition, WHO has also launched a call for expressions of interest from",
,vaccine trial sites around the world to identify those that would participate in a vaccine Solidarity Trial,
,using this core protocol.,
2.,"A multi-disciplinary group of experts from across the world to discuss, from different perspectives, to",
,develop the concept of Human Challenge Studies. The WHO Advisory Group for “Human Challenges” was,
,"tasked with considering the feasibility, potential value and limitations of establishing a closely monitored",
,human challenge model of experimental COVID-19 infection and illness in healthy young adult volunteers.,
,This Advisory Group included experts with experience in:,
,•,"design and performance of many types of volunteer challenge studies,"
,•,"SARS-CoV-2 virology,"
,•,"measurement of human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and to other microbial pathogens,"
,•,"clinical management of COVID-19 clinical disease in different geographic settings,"
,•,regulatory considerations associated with testing and emergency pre-licensure use of vaccines and
,,"with larger-scale post-licensure deployment,"
,•,and GMP manufacture of virulent viruses under BSL-3 containment.
"The Working Group was sub-divided into four subgroups to address: Clinical Trials Issues, Challenge Virus Strain",,
"Issues, Measurement of Immune Responses Pre- and Post-Challenge, and Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical",,
Specimens Post-challenge.,,

"Since its constitution, the Advisory Group has convened several times to deliberate on this question and to"
make recommendations. A full report of this Advisory Group will be available shortly on the R&D Blueprint and
COVID-19 webpage. This complements the 6 May 2020 document outlining the key criteria for the ethical
acceptability of Covid-19 human challenge studies.
Further information on WHO’s work relating to vaccine research can be found on the R&D Blueprint and
COVID-19 webpage.

WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. and. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
