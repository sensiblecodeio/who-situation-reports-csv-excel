Highlights,,
"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing yesterday, stressed that",,
"“Despite the ongoing global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot lose sight of",,
"other significant public health issues, including influenza”. WHO urges countries to",,
address the sharp decline in influenza surveillance and testing during the COVID-19,,
"pandemic, especially as the southern hemisphere enters the flu season.",,
"Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is now facing another major threat",,
to health security — COVID-19. A health care worked asked Yemenis to be extremely vigilant,,
"and protect themselves, and urged them to stay at home as health care workers put their lives",,
at unprecedented risk to save lives.,,
"In today’s Subject in Focus, we look at the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN),",,
which is tackling the spread of mis- and dis-information and rumours during the COVID-19,,
pandemic.,,

Subject in Focus: The WHO Information Network for epidemics –
listening to our stakeholders
"Since its declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (30 January 2020),"
"WHO has coordinated global response efforts, working with other United Nations agencies,"
national governments and a host of other partners. One of the primary objectives of WHO’s
Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) in the COVID-19 response is to manage
"“infodemics”, which can spread mis- and dis-information and rumours during a health"
"emergency, potentially hamper an effective response or be harmful to public health."
Infodemics management includes the use of trusted amplifiers in societies to give a wider
range of audiences the knowledge they need to take preventive measures EPI-WIN holds
technical webinars to engage with these amplifiers. Sixty webinars have been organised
"since January 2020 featuring over 270 subject matter experts and panellists. In total, the"
"webinars have reached over 12,000 participants from 121 countries."
Figure 1: Data gathered from a total of 261 respondents through surveys following both
webinars
EPI-WIN has also put in place a basic monitoring and evaluation plan to assess the webinars’
"effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, measure stakeholders’ satisfaction and track"
audience attitudes and behaviour during the COVID-19 response.

Results
"On 29 May and 2 June 2020, WHO hosted two webinars, entitled “returning to work” (1400"
participants) and “Vaccines—the science” (600 participants); questionnaires were sent to
"samples of participants, with 192 and 55 respondents completing the survey respectively. The"
surveys included 20 questions asking participants to indicate whether the webinar met their
"expectations on a five-point scale (1: fully met, to 5: not met), 65% gave a score of 1 or 2,"
"indicating that expectations had been met. Questions also covered demographics (i.e. age,"
"gender and country of residence), ‘amplification potential’ (i.e. participants’ social media"
"engagement, outreach potential for further information dissemination, and the sentiment of"
pandemic in their professional environment.
Fostering a culture of continuous learning
Eighty percent of the respondents were satisfied (their questions addressed during the
"webinars), nevertheless, one lesson captured from the surveys was that innovative ways to"
facilitate and encourage greater interaction between participants should be explored. One
"solution in the making is to develop a community of practice platform, to complement EPI-"
WIN webinars.
Further information on WHO’s work relating to vaccine research can be found on the R&D
Blueprint and COVID-19 webpage.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
