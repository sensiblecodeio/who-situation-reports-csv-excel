Highlights,,
"WHO welcomes initial clinical trial results from the United Kingdom that show dexamethasone, a",,
"corticosteroid, can be lifesaving for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. According to preliminary",,
"findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by",,
"about one third, and for patients who only require oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth.",,
Older people have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders from around the world have,,
"expressed their concern, and called for a response that addresses the needs and rights of older people.",,
"Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO), has called on countries",,
"to “work together to strengthen the health response within their territories and across frontiers,” in",,
order to contain the spread of COVID-19 among migrant and vulnerable populations in border areas.,,
"PAHO has extended its alliance with Twitter to provide factual, reliable information on the COVID-19",,
pandemic in the Americas. An agreement recently signed with the platform will enable it to continue training,,
public health social media managers and provide advertising credits to PAHO for the dissemination of,,
evidence-based information.,,

Subject in Focus: WHO support to the COVID-19 response in Africa,
"Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Africa in mid-February, the pace of the outbreak has",
"accelerated, taking 98 days to reach the first 100 000 cases and only 19 days to rise to 200 000 cases.",
"As of 11 June, more than 200 000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 5600 deaths have been reported from",
Africa – a nearly 30% increase in cases as compared to the previous week.,
"Many countries have put in place lockdowns and public health measures to promote physical distancing,",
good hand hygiene and isolating cases and testing and tracing of contacts of people with COVID-19. With the,
"support of WHO and other partners, governments also rapidly scaled up health workforce and laboratory",
"capacities, and set up points-of-entry screening at airports and border crossings.",
"Over the past week, WHO Regional Office for Africa has supported the rollout of a Partnership to Accelerate",
"Testing in Africa (PACT) to increase testing, tracing and treatment in the region. The initiative aims to train",
"100 000 health workers, test up to 15 million people per month for next six months and support provision of",
supportive care to patients.,
"Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO has partnered with the Africa Centres for Disease Control",
and Prevention (CDC) to provide technical support and coordinate the distribution of medical supplies for the,
COVID-19 response across Africa.,
Africa CDC is also an active partner in the diagnostics purchasing consortium convened by WHO to approach,
markets through a pooled procurement process in order to access and secure testing supplies amidst,
unprecedented global demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,
"Through the consortium, WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) has secured from a number of",
manufacturers of manual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and has begun shipping to Africa the,
following diagnostic supplies:,
•,227 752 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests
•,104 000 sample collection kits
An additional 857 100 PCR tests and 780 300 sample collection kits have been prepared and are awaiting,
shipment.,
"WHO, in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), which is distributing personal protective",
"equipment (PPE) cargo for the global COVID-19 response, is in the process of shipping to countries across",
"Africa massive volumes of PPE, including:",
•,10.8 million medical masks
•,1.3 million N95 respirator masks
•,938 157 gowns
•,103 544 goggles
•,7.5 million examination gloves
•,741 334 face shields
"WHO’s pooled procurement process to secure biomedical equipment for clinical care, which has been",
"especially difficult to procure amidst a global shortage, has also yielded results in recent weeks. WHO has",
"procured 2,522 oxygen concentrators and 487 ventilators, for WFP to deliver across the region.",

"WHO’s OSL unit, with the voluntary support of a technical network of architects and engineers, is also"
supporting the design of COVID-19 treatment centres in a number of countries in Africa. Working with
"Ministry of Health and other UN partners, the OSL’s technical HelpDesk has supported the establishment"
"of COVID-19 treatment centres in Senegal, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria,"
"Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Mauritius and Ghana. Presently, OSL is working with to support"
"a 26-bed facility in Chad, a 30-bed facility in Burkina Faso, and a 500-bed facility in Equatorial Guinea."

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. and. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
