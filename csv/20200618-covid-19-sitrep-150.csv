Subject in Focus: Advice on feeding and caring for infants and young,
children of mothers with COVID-19,
"WHO published updated guidance on clinical care, including feeding and caring for infants",
"and young children of mothers with COVID-19 on 27 May 2020, replacing the previous",
guidance originally published on 13 March 2020.,
WHO continues to advise that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be,
"encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding. From the available evidence, mothers",
should be counselled that the benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the,
potential risks for transmission.,
Mother and infant should be enabled to remain together throughout the day and night,
"and practise skin-to-skin contact, including kangaroo mother care, especially immediately",
"after birth and when they first start breastfeeding, whether they or their infants have",
suspected or confirmed COVID-19.,
Here is a snapshot of what’s included in the updated guidance:,
Advice on mother-infant contact at birth,
•,Mothers should not be separated from their infants unless the mother is too sick to
,care for her baby. If the mother is unable to care for the infant another competent
,family caregiver should be identified.
•,Neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be
,breastfed within one hour of birth. Early and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact
,between mothers and infants should be facilitated and encouraged as soon as
,"possible after birth, while applying necessary measures for infection prevention and"
,control (IPC).
•,"If the newborn or infant is ill and requires specialist care (such as neonatal unit),"
,"arrangements should be made to allow the mother free access to the unit, with"
,appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.
Advice for mothers who are severely ill,
•,In situations when severe illness in a mother prevents her from caring for her infant
,"or prevents her from continuing direct breastfeeding, mothers should be"
,"encouraged and supported to express milk, and the breastmilk provided safely to"
,"the infant, while applying appropriate IPC measures."
•,"In the event that the mother is too unwell to breastfeed or express breastmilk,"
,"explore the viability of feeding with donor human milk. If this is not possible,"
,consider wet nursing (defined as another woman breastfeeding the child) or
,"appropriate breastmilk substitutes, informed by feasibility, safety, sustainability,"
,"cultural context, acceptability to mother and service availability."

•,Mothers who are not able to initiate breastfeeding during the first hour after,
,delivery should still be supported to breastfeed as soon as they are able. Assistance,
,should be provided after recovery for relactation to re-establish a milk supply and,
,continue breastfeeding.,
General advice for mothers during all infant and childcare,,
•,Breastfeeding mothers should be helped to clean her chest with soap and water if,
,she has been coughing on it before breastfeeding. She does not need to wash her,
,breasts prior to every breastfeed.,
•,"While mothers are recommended to wear medical masks, if the mother does not",
,"have a medical mask, she should still be encouraged to continue breastfeeding as",
,the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of transmission of the,
,virus when breastfeeding while applying other IPC measures.,
Best practices for breastfeeding,,
•,"There should be no promotion of breastmilk substitutes, feeding bottles and teats,",
,pacifiers or dummies in any part of facilities providing maternity and newborn,
,"services, or by any of the staff. Health facilities and their staff should not give",
,feeding bottles and teats or other products that are within the scope of the,
,International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and its subsequent,
,"related WHA resolutions, to infants.",
For more advice for healthcare workers or the public on feeding and care of infants and,,
"young children of mothers with COVID-19, please visit FAQs on pregnancy, Childbirth and",,
"COVID-19 and breastfeeding and COVID-19, for healthcare workers. In addition, health",,
"workers can also access training materials on breastfeeding and childbirth,",,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"

"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"

"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"

"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
