"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 19 June 2020",,
Highlights,,
"The hydroxychloroquine arm of the Solidarity Trial, which seeks to find an effective COVID-",,
"19 treatment, is being stopped. The decision is based on evidence from the Solidarity Trial,",,
the UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence,,
on hydroxychloroquine. Data shows that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of,,
"mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.",,
"Dr Tedros announced the roll out of the WHO Academy, a major new initiative as part of",,
"WHO’s transformation. With the WHO Academy, WHO aims to build one of the world’s",,
largest and most innovative digital learning platforms to enhance the competencies of health,,
"professionals. So far, courses on the OpenWHO.org have received almost 3.5 million",,
enrolments on 12 topics in 31 languages.,,
Several countries affected by COVID-19 have seen increases in levels of violence occurring,,
"in the home, including violence against children, intimate partner violence and violence",,
"against older people. A new brief, addressing violence against children, women and older people",,
"during the COVID-19 pandemic, outlines key actions that the health sector can undertake to",,
prevent or mitigate interpersonal violence.,,
Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ provides a summary of virtual meetings held on COVID-19,,
preparedness and response at points of entry from the WHO Regional Office for Africa.,,

Subject in Focus: Sharing experiences and lessons in COVID-19,
preparedness and response at points of entry in West African,
countries,
"Earlier this month, WHO Regional Office for Africa, Dakar Hub, in partnership with West African",
"Health Organization (WAHO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), International Civil",
"Aviation Organization (ICAO) and West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Mano",
"River Union, organized a workshop to strengthen cross-border collaboration through sharing of",
experiences and lessons learned in preparing for and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in,
West Africa.,
The objectives of the workshop were to:,
•,Update the countries participants on the recent development of COVID-19 response in
,Points of Entry (PoE);
•,Share countries experiences on the implementation of COVID-19 preparedness and
,response at PoE;
•,Identify gaps in IHR core capacities mainly in the PoE; and
•,Agree on next steps to strengthen Member State cross border collaboration.
The workshop was attended by 255 participants representing 17 West African countries including:,
"Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo-Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,",
"Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Togo.",
Key issues discussed included the organization of and public health measures implemented at,
PoE; sharing of challenges and lessons in preparedness and response activities; planned activities,
for opening the borders; cross-border collaboration agreements or mechanisms; and utilization of,
the leverage of the regional polio cross border coordination and control mechanism.,
Among the lessons and outcomes of the workshop was:,
•,An enhanced understanding of COVID-19 preparedness and response at PoE.
•,"That all countries have implemented pandemic response measures, with systems to detect"
,"cases of COVID-19, at PoEs but with a stronger focus on aerial PoEs."
•,"Several good practices have been implemented, including the development of passenger"
,"self-reporting forms, and development of guidelines/protocols for reopening PoEs."
•,"Cross-border collaboration mechanisms and frameworks have been activated, and meetings"
,have been organized at the PoEs.
•,"The majority of the challenges identified are similar, and primarily related to organization,"
,"human resources, and equipment."
"As next steps, similar exercises will be undertaken with ten Central African countries, and a",
technical report and regional roadmap will be developed and disseminated.,

WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus,,,,
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting"
"practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst"
"others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and"
"death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia"
"and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such"
data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This

will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details,
"become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days,",
graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see,
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases"
,not linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab
