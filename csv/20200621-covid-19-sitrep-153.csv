Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update 17 June 2020, India: India has reported a large increase in deaths in the last 24"
,"hours, possibly due to a data reconciliation process. Edit 21 June 2020: Local authorities"
,confirmed that the significant increase of deaths reported earlier this week was due to
,a backlog in data reporting from Delhi and Mumbai.
•,"Update 21 June 2020, Brazil: A large increase observed on this day was in part due to a"
,"lag in reporting from three states (Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo), compounding"
,data from two days.
•,"Erratum 21 June 2020, Czechia: Counts adjusted retrospectively to align with national"
,authorities: 54 cases have been excluded on 20 June.
•,"Erratum 21 June 2020, Germany: Counts adjusted retrospectively to align with national"
,authorities: 1 death has been excluded on 20 June.
