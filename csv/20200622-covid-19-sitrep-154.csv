Highlights,,
"With influenza season starting in the southern hemisphere, WHO has alerted countries to maintain vigilance",,
for influenza and prepare for the upcoming influenza season during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO,,
recommends that countries optimize the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for both,,
"influenza and COVID-19 sentinel surveillance. Countries are urged to (i) sustain influenza surveillance, (ii)",,
"report surveillance data to WHO FluNet and FluID or through regional platforms, (iii) send representative",,
"viruses to WHO Collaborating Centres of GISRS without delay, and (iv) maintain influenza vaccination programs",,
according to WHO guidance.,,
A team of public health experts has been deployed to Tajikistan through the Global Outbreak Alert and,,
Response Network (GOARN). The team will provide support to strengthen disease surveillance and laboratory,,
testing to complement ongoing work by the COVID-19 response team in Tajikistan.,,
WHO and collaborating agencies provided support to health authorities in Uzbekistan to assess their options,,
for COVID-19 testing and identify potential resources in-country to increase their laboratory capacity.,,
A nurse who is a refugee from Syria shared his experience as a COVID-19 responder in Turkey. His daily,,
activities as part of the contact tracing team are “actively preventing the spread of the disease within,,
"communities, thereby protecting the health of hundreds of people”.",,

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. and. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
"• Update 22 June 2020, Uganda: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: 68 cases",
have been excluded.,
