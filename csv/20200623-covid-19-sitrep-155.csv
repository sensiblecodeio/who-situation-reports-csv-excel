Subject in Focus: Sports events and COVID-19: from lockdown to a
new start
"On 18 June 2020, WHO’s Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) hosted a webinar on"
“Sports events and COVID-19: from lockdown to a new start ”. It was attended by over 500
participants from across all six WHO Regions.
"Sport promotes physical activity, health and community engagement. It also plays a"
significant role in local and national economies and supports a range of livelihoods. Sport’s
"reach and appeal cannot be underestimated: for example, it is estimated that there are some"
four billion football fans around the world. Sports venues serve a wider economic and social
"function not limited to sports events, including through hosting music concerts and other"
functions.
"However, during the COVID-2019 pandemic, many countries have implemented public health"
"and social measures that restrict or prohibit mass gatherings, including the participation in"
"and attendance of sports events. As these measures are relaxed in several countries, how"
"should national governments, sports associations, teams and venues move towards a “new"
"start”, while ensuring the health and safety of all involved?"
The webinar featured speakers from WHO headquarters and regional offices; the
International Olympic Committee (IOC); the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of
South Africa; the Adelaide Oval sports ground in Australia; the Fédération Internationale de
Football Association (FIFA); Flinders University Australia; Griffith University Australia; and
World Rugby.
"Resuming sports events and reopening venues depends on a number of factors, ranging"
from the current epidemiological situation and existing public health measures
"recommended by authorities, to the expected size of crowds and venue capacity for individual"
events. Decisions on if and how events should go ahead must be based on a risk assessments
"including all these factors, and the decision-making process should be sufficiently flexible to"
account for the changing context.
"Although the various sports are very different in nature, the advice WHO has to offer is the"
same: the decision if an event can proceed or be cancelled should always rely on a risk-based
"approach. This includes three pillars: risk evaluation, risk control and mitigation, and"
"communication of risk and decisions to stakeholders. To support this process, the WHO has"
"published a set of risk assessment tools, which several partners further adapted for specific"
purposes.
Panellists discussed what measures can be implemented to eliminate or mitigate the risk of
"transmission. While some sports leagues have held matches without spectators, venues in"
"other countries have reopened with a range of measures in place, including: restricting the"
number of spectators per square meter to facilitate physical distancing; installing hand-
washing stations; limiting congregation in entrances and exits; and use of mobile electronic
"ticketing. At the Adelaide Oval, for example, the numbers of spectators are limited through an"
"online lottery, and messages are sent three hours before each event to remind them of their"
responsibility to not attend if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. All these measures
must also take into consideration how spectators travel to and from the venue.
"Sporting federations such as the IOC, FIFA and World Rugby have a key role to play in"
"assessing risks and setting standards. For its part, World Rugby published its"
recommendations for a Safe Return to Rugby in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic on 27

"April 2020. Being a contact sport, rugby carries an inherent but limited risk of COVID-19"
"transmission between players, and World Rugby has taken the lead in assessing these risks"
"and developing guidelines for safe training and matches. Other federations, such as the IOC,"
are involved in multiple different sports each with their own considerations for risk mitigation
strategies.
Responses to past infectious disease outbreaks can inform approaches to confronting the
risks posed by COVID-19. The panellist from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
of South Africa described the experience of South Africa ten years ago as it prepared to host
"the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which drew in around four million spectators and 350,000 foreign"
"visitors. At the time, the H1N1 (2009) influenza virus pandemic had been declared a Public"
"Health Emergency of International Concern, while the country was also experiencing a"
"measles outbreak with 17,000 cases. Risk reduction measures included a measles mass"
vaccination campaign which was completed in early 2010 and strengthening of the country’s
national infectious diseases surveillance programme.
Measures to bring about a “new start” for sport in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic
"should be developed in consultation with legal, public health and occupational health experts,"
"and with specific consideration to the epidemiological context, the type of sports events in"
"question, and the characteristics of the venues where they will take place."

A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that

"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
