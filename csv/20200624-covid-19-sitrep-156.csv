Subject in Focus: COVID-19 Supply Chain System – Progress Update
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
"Through the PPE purchasing consortium, WHO has secured large volumes of equipment that"
are being shipped to 135 countries in the coming weeks. A total of more than 239 million items
– comprising 141 million PPE procured by WHO and a donation by the Jack Ma Foundation of
100 million medical masks and 1 million N95 respirator masks – have been allocated to all
WHO regions and are being shipped in the coming weeks
Recent discussions with 54 private sector organizations addressed issues related to quality
"assurance of PPE, which continues to be of major concern to manufacturers, buyers and"
governments. They urge WHO to advocate at the highest levels to ensure that counterfeit and
low-quality products are not sold in the market. WHO and purchasing consortia partners
continue to engage with suppliers to ensure that all goods procured by WHO and consortia
partners meet quality assurance standards.
Diagnostics
WHO has procured 4.5 million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests through the diagnostics
purchasing consortium. Tests are being produced and packed by suppliers for shipment in
"the coming weeks. As of 15 June, 585 830 tests have been shipped to 10 countries."
"WHO has also procured 4.8 million sample collection kits, of which 1.04 million kits are ready"
"to ship. As of 15 June, 114 000 sample kits have been sent to 29 countries."
"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has procured 298 000 tests, of which 123 000"
have been shipped to 18 countries.
Biomedical Equipment
"Following an initial procurement of 4000 oxygen concentrators, WHO has purchased an"
"additional 10 000 oxygen concentrators, 9800 pulse oximeters and consumables"
"(estimated total value: USD 10 million), which will be distributed to more than 120"
"countries. To date, 2000 oxygen concentrators have been shipped, and 2000 are in transit."
COVID-19 Supply Portal
"So far, 48 countries have submitted requests for supplies valued at more than USD 92 million"
"through the COVID-19 Supply Portal, an online platform WHO launched in May through which"
countries that need supplies for the COVID-19 response can enter requests.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
