Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 157,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 25 June 2020",,
Highlights,,
"Speaking at the 24 June media briefing on COVID-19, the Director-General highlighted work by",,
"WHO and UN partners to ensure global supplies of oxygen for treating patients, and discussed",,
the difficult choices all countries must make in holding gatherings of large numbers of people.,,
The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo today declared the end of the,,
country’s 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease. Many of the public health measures that have,,
been successful in stopping Ebola remaining essential for suppressing COVID-19. Healthcare,,
"workers trained in clinical management, and infection prevention and control, as part of the",,
Ebola response are redeploying to fight COVID-19.,,
"As cases of COVID-19 in the Americas remain high, WHO’s Regional Director for the Americas,",,
Dr Carissa F. Etienne cautioned that “We must be realistic about the future: all of us must adjust,,
to a new way of life and redefine our sense of normal.” She reiterated “though we rejoice when,,
"one country successfully flattens its COVID-19 epidemic curve, the risk of re-emergence will",,
always remain unless we flatten the curve regionally and globally.”,,
Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ discusses an update on the interim guidance on Critical,,
"preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19.",,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,9 296 202 cases (167 056),479 133 deaths (5 336)
Africa,248 558 cases (9 010),5 441 deaths (151)
Americas,4 604 134 cases (97 128),230 165 deaths (3 661)
Eastern Mediterranean,969 656 cases (18 926),22 003 deaths (564)
Europe,2 600 590 cases (18 988),194 972 deaths (442)
South-East Asia,663 308 cases (22 160),19 156 deaths (493)
Western Pacific,209 215 cases (844),7 383 deaths (25)

Subject in Focus: Update to the Interim guidance on Critical,,
"preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19",,
"As the pandemic evolves, so do the actions required by each country as they face different",,
"transmission scenarios. On 24 June, WHO updated the interim guidance on the critical",,
"preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19. This replaces the previous",,
"version, published on 22 March.",,
WHO has defined four transmission scenarios for COVID 19:,,
1.,No cases: Countries/ territories/ areas with no cases;,
2.,"Sporadic cases: Countries/ territories/ areas with one or more cases, imported or",
,locally detected;,
3.,"Clusters of cases: Countries/ territories/ areas experiencing cases, clustered in time,",
,"geographic location, and/or by common exposure;",
4.,Community transmission: Countries/ territories/areas experiencing larger outbreaks of,
,"local transmission, defined through an assessment of factors including, but not limited",
,to:,
,•,Large numbers of cases which cannot be linked to transmission chains
,•,Large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance or increasing positive
,,tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory
,,samples from established laboratories)
,•,Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
Several countries have demonstrated that COVID-19 transmission from one person to,,
another can be controlled. The “No cases” transmission scenario now covers both countries,,
"that have never had any COVID-19 cases and countries that previously had COVID-19 cases,",,
but currently have no active cases.,,
The updated guidance document provides an overview of the key actions and links to WHO,,
interim guidance documents according to each transmission scenario. This covers emergency,,
"response mechanisms, risk communication and community engagement, epidemiological",,
"surveillance, contact tracing, public health measures, infection prevention and control,",,
"laboratory testing, case management strategies, maintaining essential health services and",,
societal responses.,,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
