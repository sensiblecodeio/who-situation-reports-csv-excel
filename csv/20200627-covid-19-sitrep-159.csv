Situation Report – 159,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 27 June 2020",,
The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is a global initiative between multiple partners to,,
ensure equitable access to life-saving tools for COVID-19. WHO has published the ACT-Accelerator,,
"Investment Case, which provides an overview of the ACT-Accelerator, its goals, and the investments",,
that are required to carry out its mission. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros emphasized that,,
"“vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics are vital tools – but to be truly effective they must be",,
"administered with another essential ingredient, which is solidarity”.",,
"WHO has published interim guidance on rapid hospital readiness and an accompanying checklist tool,",,
which can be used to monitor the development of operational readiness capacity in hospitals and,,
"identify gaps that require investment and action. The checklist covers hospital governance, structures,",,
plans and protocols to rapidly determine the current capacities of hospitals to respond to COVID-19.,,
WHO has published interim guidance on biomedical equipment for COVID-19 case management and,,
"an accompanying inventory tool, which countries can use to collect in-depth facility inventories of",,
"biomedical equipment re-allocation, procurement and planning for COVID-19 case management. The",,
tool is intended for use from the early stages of an emergency to early recovery.,,
"In Nigeria, more than 12 000 doctors, pharmacists, medical students and other health workers are",,
offering their expertise and time to curb the spread of COVID-19. A nurse volunteering at a,,
hospital in Abuja has forgone time with family so as not to put her family at risk. She says few are,,
"willing to be in the frontlines of the pandemic response, but “if someone must be there, then I should",,
be.”,,

(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period,,,,
of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected,
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other",
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to,
"ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case",
"detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between",
"countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with",
"variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data",
at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of",
"any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or",
"area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and",
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full,
"agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.",
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they,
are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not,
"mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by",
initial capital letters.,
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security,
"Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244,",
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless",
"stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both",
domestic and repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large,
"numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative",
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in,
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the,
"subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior",
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes,
available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas;,
classification is based on the highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to"
,transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple
,unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar",
status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update 27 June 2020, Belgium: Retrospective counts adjusted based on additional data"
,received to apportion excluded cases and deaths to the date they were initially reported.
,Retrospective adjustments made from 2 March to 26 June as national authorities revised
,their historical data.
•,"Update 27 June 2020, Italy: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: 148"
,cases added on 19 June
•,"Update 27 June 2020, Spain: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: 813"
,deaths were excluded on 2 and 3 June; 812 deaths were excluded on 4 June; 419 cases
,and 8 deaths were reported on 26 June.
•,"Update 27 June 2020, Curaçao: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: 1"
,case was excluded.
