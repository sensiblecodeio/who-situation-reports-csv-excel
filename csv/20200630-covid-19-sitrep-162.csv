Highlights,,
Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian emergency and the already vulnerable people of,,
Yemen are facing the added threat of COVID-19. This new burden on medical facilities could,,
result in a catastrophic death toll. WHO and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief,,
Centre have joined forces to ensure access to healthcare for the vulnerable in remote areas,,
through the provision of a minimum service package.,,
UNICEF and WHO have supported a national immunization campaign in Syria amid the COVID-,,
19 pandemic. There has been about a 5% reduction in vaccination coverage in the first half of,,
"2020, mainly as a result of challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 5-day",,
"immunization campaign, implemented by the Syrian Ministry of Health, health workers checked",,
the vaccination status of more than 900 000 children and vaccinated more than 210 100,,
children.,,
"To promote community empowerment and trust, a ‘Global Risk Communication and",,
"Community Engagement Collective Service’ has been launched by WHO, UNICEF and IFRC with",,
support from the Global Outbreak and Response Network and the Bill and Melinda Gates,,

Subject in Focus: A partnership for a global risk communication and,
community engagement collective service to beat COVID-19,
Effective risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) is critical for the successful,
implementation of almost any emergency programming – its importance is even more,
"significant during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
"COVID-19 is now a global health crisis, an information crisis and increasingly a wider socio-",
"economic crisis. As such, the unprecedented impacts on society require the broadest range of",
humanitarian and public health partners working together.,
"Given the breadth and range of societal impacts the virus is now causing, consistent and open",
engagement with the broadest range of communities is also paramount for maintaining,
"trust, public solidarity and promoting local action.",
"As learned from experience, for example, during the West Africa Ebola outbreak (2013-2016),",
when community empowerment and partnership is not placed at the centre of an epidemic,
"response, the resulting loss of trust in these efforts can have devastating public health and",
broader impacts.,
To promote community empowerment and trust through the entire course of the COVID-19,
"response and further strengthen RCCE coordination at all levels, a Global Risk Communication",
"and Community Engagement Collective Service has been launched by WHO, UNICEF and the",
"International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC), with support from the Global",
Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,
"As part of a phased approach, two service hubs will be established in the African region with",
dedicated human resources first deployed in Senegal and Kenya. To promote better global,
"coordination, a team will also be established in Geneva.",
The service will not replace any established coordination mechanisms but is designed to,
"reinforce ongoing global, regional and national efforts and ensure more predictable,",
systematic and consistent RCCE support is available to regions and countries as they tackle,
the pandemic.,
"Specifically, the Global Collective Service, on behalf of the three lead agencies supported by",
"GOARN, will improve greater collaboration among key stakeholders at all levels, supporting",
"the coordinated delivery of the RCCE strategy produced by WHO, UNICEF, and IFRC, as well as",
the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and the COVID-19 Global,
Humanitarian Response Plan.,
The collective service will work across four strategic areas to:,
1.,"Strengthen coordinated approaches in order to maximize the sharing of resources,"
,"information and expertise at global, regional and country levels;"
2.,Improve quality and shift the focus towards community engagement approaches
,"grounded on social data, perceptions and community insights which regularly inform"
,"public health measures, inter-agency standards and monitoring frameworks;"
3.,"Amplify the views and perspectives of communities, enabling them to influence"
,decision-making within the response; and
4.,"Strengthen local capacity and existing coordination mechanisms, through RCCE"
,mentoring support and resource sharing with local actors working in the public
,"health, humanitarian and development sectors."

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
