Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 163,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 1 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
It has never been clearer that communication is an important public health intervention that,,
contributes to controlling pandemics. The WHO Regional Office for Europe discusses this and,,
"the risks of an “infodemic” – an overabundance of information, some of which can be",,
"misleading or even harmful. WHO launched the first Infodemiology conference on 29 June,",,
which includes talks with experts on how the infodemic affects the world and reflections on,,
how it can be managed.,,
Cambodia has been responding to a measles outbreak at the same time as the COVID-19,,
outbreak. WHO has supported efforts for routine immunization in Cambodia at health care,,
"facilities, and in the community through outreach teams.",,
"WHO has published an update to the scientific brief on smoking and COVID-19, which assesses",,
"the available evidence on the risk of smokers being infected by the virus, severity of disease,",,
and deaths among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who smoke. The conclusion remains that,,
smoking appears associated with increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized,,
COVID-19 patients.,,
"In today’s Subject in Focus below, we provide an update on WHO’s efforts to bolster the COVID-",,
19 supply chain system.,,

Subject in Focus: COVID-19 Supply Chain System – Progress Update
Personal Protective Equipment
"Through the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) purchasing consortium, WHO has secured"
"140.8 million pieces of equipment, which are being shipped to 135 countries in all WHO"
regions. WHO is also delivering an additional 100 million medical masks and 1 million N95
respirators donated by the Jack Ma Foundation.
"In the WHO Region of the Americas, PPE has been delivered to Ecuador and shipments are"
"presently en route to Peru, Barbados, Belize, El Salvador, Paraguay, and Venezuela."
A total of 41 million PPE items are being prepared for delivery as a matter of priority to all
African countries in the coming weeks.
"PPE for allocation to all Eastern Mediterranean Region countries has arrived in Dubai, United"
"Arab Emirates, and are being prepared for shipment."
"In the European Region, PPE has been delivered to Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Ukraine."
"Allocations to Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova are ready to ship and will be dispatched in the"
coming week.
Diagnostics
"Through the diagnostics purchasing consortium, WHO, UNICEF and the Global Fund have"
"procured close to 6 million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests from several manufacturers,"
for allocation to 132 countries.
Tests are being produced and packed by suppliers for shipment in the coming weeks. As of 29
"June, 392 258 PCR tests have been delivered to 28 countries. An additional 1.4 million tests are"
presently in transit to 40 countries.
"A total of 5.2 million sample collection kits have been procured, of which 184 640 kits have"
"been delivered to 19 countries. Currently, 235 020 sample collection kits are in transit to 24"
countries.
The Diagnostics Pillar has completed the following documentation to clarify the diagnostics
request and allocation process:
Principles guiding the diagnostics allocation process
Procedures for requesting diagnostics tests through the COVID-19 Supply Portal
Frequently asked questions regarding technical issues related to diagnostic tests
Biomedical Equipment
"Many countries have had particular difficulty obtaining oxygen concentrators, which produce"
medical oxygen and are essential to saving the lives of patients with severe COVID-19. By
working with private sector networks to purchase oxygen concentrators from the handful of
"manufacturers around the world that produce this equipment, WHO and consortium partners"

are beginning to deliver these lifesaving devices to countries most in need. Of the initial 4000,
"oxygen concentrators WHO has procured, 3265 have been delivered to 18 countries and 637",
are in transit to 10 additional countries.,
"Of the second procurement of 10 000 oxygen concentrators, 5000 have been delivered to a",
warehouse in China and are being prepared for shipment in July.,
COVID-19 Supply Portal,
"Since the launch of the COVID-19 Supply Portal, 312 requests for essential supplies have been",
submitted (as of 26 June 2020).,
WHO encourages national authorities and partners to request submissions through the,
COVID-19 Supply Portal in support of national response plans. Member States may request,
"supplies using any source of funding, including government and donor financing.",
Technical field support for COVID-19 treatment centres,
"WHO’s Operations Support Logistics (OSL) Technical HelpDesk, in collaboration with a",
"network of architects and engineers, is supporting the design of COVID-19 treatment centres",
in:,
▪,Italy: WHO is supporting the Italian Ministry of Health (MoH) in the development of
,"procedures for the post-acute COVID-19 phase. In the Emilia Romagna region, WHO"
,is working with the MoH regional health authorities to rehabilitate emergency room
,units in all hospitals in the region to strengthen IPC standards and adapt patient
,and staff pathways to accommodate post-acute COVID-19 care services. The project
,will start with two of the biggest hospitals (2000- bed and 2500-bed capacity) to
,assess and evaluate new standards and designs for a region-wide project.
▪,Ghana: WHO is supporting the opening of a 68-bed capacity COVID-19 field hospital to
,provide medical evacuation services for the West and Central Africa region. The
,hospital will be managed by a private emergency medical company and is scheduled
,to begin operations in July.
▪,Mozambique: WHO is supporting the review of the layout of two laboratories funded
,by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of the country’s
,efforts to scale up COVID-19 testing capacity.
▪,Burkina Faso: The design and layout of a 30-bed capacity multipurpose permanent
,structure in Dori is nearing completion of.
▪,"Chad: Work is in progress, in coordination with the MoH and the World Food"
,"Programme (WFP), to repurpose existing facilities to set up three COVID-19 treatment"
,"centers, each with a 26-bed capacity."

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"

expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"

"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. and. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
