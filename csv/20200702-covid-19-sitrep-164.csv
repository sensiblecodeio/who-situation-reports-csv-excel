WHO Director-General Dr Tedros has emphasized the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to,,
responding to the pandemic -- “Not testing alone. Not physical distancing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not,,
"masks alone. Do it all”, he said during yesterday’s regular media briefing.",,
"In Turkey, a WHO-backed helpline has been created to provide psychosocial health support to persons affected",,

Subject in Focus: Updated guidance on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC),
WHO has updated the interim guidance on infection prevention and control during healthcare when,
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed.,
"This is the third edition of the guidance and expands the scope and structure of earlier guidance, bringing",
together other interim recommendations as well as considerations and advice from subject matter experts.,
The main differences and additions compared to the previous versions include the following:,
•,expansion of all sub-sections to include clarifications and further recommendations;
•,addition of new guidance and practical advice for the management of visitors especially in areas with
,COVID-19 community transmission;
•,inclusion of a sub-section on ventilation in the section “Environmental and engineering controls”;
•,new guidance on IPC considerations for surgical procedures for patients with suspected or confirmed
,"COVID-19, as well as those patients whose COVID-19 status is unknown;"
•,updated considerations for dead body management in healthcare facilities; and
•,practical advice and tools to assess healthcare facility IPC readiness and to monitor and evaluate IPC
,measures for COVID-19.
"This guidance is intended for health workers, including healthcare managers and IPC teams at the facility",
"level, but it is also relevant for the national and district/provincial levels.",

document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.",
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmissionclassification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing degrees of,
transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest,
category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
"• Update 2 July 2020, Israel: Counts adjusted by national authorities: an additional 15 cases on 1 July.",
