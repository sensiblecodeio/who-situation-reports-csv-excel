Highlights,,
"COVID-19 has changed our life: disinfectants, hand sanitizers, and personal protective",,
equipment (PPE) have become tools in the fight against virus transmission. Most of these,,
products contain chemicals. A webinar is being held tomorrow during which speakers will,,
share the preliminary analysis of the chemical impact [of using these products] and outline,,
recommendations to ensure the safety of chemical products being used to stop the spreading,,
of the virus.,,
As a major United Nations forum prepares to assess progress towards a fairer future for people,,
"and the planet, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that each of the Goals of",,
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.,,
In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below we present an update from the Global Outbreak Alert and,,

Subject in Focus: Update from the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners are currently supporting 24
international deployments through WHO for COVID-19 response. These deployments are
"mainly in infection prevention and control, epidemiology, laboratory support, and case"
"management. Current international deployments include technical assistance to Angola,"
"Bangladesh, Nepal, and São Tomé and Príncipe."
"Travel restriction and border closures, together with isolation and quarantine policies"
"implemented in response to COVID-19, have made it difficult for GOARN partners to deploy"
experts and responders to countries.
"On 30 June 2020, WHO, GOARN, and the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri)"
launched the 6-week ArcGIS Foundational Training Course for GOARN partners online.
"ArcGIS, a state-of-the-art geographic information system (GIS) platform from Esri, can"
"drastically enhance GOARN partners’ outbreak response capacity. Esri, the global leader in"
"location intelligence, is providing a free license for the ArcGIS COVID-19 Response Package to all"
non-profit organizations responding to the pandemic.
"To leverage this opportunity, between 30 June to 4 August, GOARN is providing a 6-week"
virtually facilitated training event for 2 cohorts of partner organizations to strengthen the
country-level technical capacity for mounting an effective response against COVID-19 and other
future outbreaks. A total of 44 individuals representing 27 GOARN Partner institutions across 19
"countries in all regions of the world are participating in this initiative, delivered by a global"
faculty of 13 GIS and virtual training experts from 7 partner institutions.
"By the end of the foundational training course, the participants will be able to communicate"
"better with those providing specialized GIS support, collect and process data to visualize and"
"monitor outbreak trends and risks, and thus make more precise and timely real-time"
operational decisions using GIS technology. GOARN thanks the generous contribution of the
"ArcGIS trainers from: Esri, George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, GISCorps, Pacific"
"Disaster Center, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and WHO Headquarters. For more"
"information, visit: https://learn.arcgis.com/en/paths/goarn."
"The tripartite -WHO, UNICEF, IFRC - Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE)"
"partners are establishing a collective service model to deliver RCCE interventions, tools and"
"guidance for both public health and humanitarian contexts, learning from recent outbreaks"
like the Ebola outbreak.
GOARN continues to support the three agencies and is looking at how best GOARN can work
"with WHO, UNICEF and the IRFC as a partner in RCCE activities, following the recent feedback"
"from the 27th GOARN Steering committee, held virtually over two days on 29/30 June, 2020."
GOARN presented to the Global RCCE Collaboration the outcomes of the contact tracing
consultation that took place from 9 - 11 June 2020. The RCCE partners have been asked to
develop an outline of the key RCCE principles that need to inform the contact tracing strategy
for COVID-19 and provide guidance on how contact tracing could be best rolled out across
"different response scenarios – including in humanitarian settings, among migrant populations,"
and in densely populated areas of the world.
GOARN hosts weekly calls of the RCCE partners and provides a virtual collaborative platform for
"the RCCE partners to share experience, tools and guidance among the network."

"To support Ministries of Health and institutions in the COVID-19 response, including contact"
"tracing, WHO and GOARN partners – “the Go.Data team” continue to roll out and implement"
activities in close collaboration with all WHO regional offices and country offices. Activities
"include briefings, trainings, user support and IT support, and technical advice. In addition, the"
recently launched Go.Data community of practice (https://community-godata.who.int/) is
gaining more attention among the Go.Data user base.
To date over 440 requests for information and support have been received and addressed. Of
these over 50 Go.Data implementations are in place.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.

"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
