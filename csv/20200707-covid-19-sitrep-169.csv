Situation Report – 169,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 7 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO encourages Member States to invest in and build longer-term health emergency preparedness during the,,
"COVID-19 pandemic. To support this goal, WHO has published guidance that maps COVID-19 preparedness and",,
response actions; locates relevant supporting WHO resources; and advocates for the conscious and effective,,
allocation of COVID-19 funds to also meet countries’ longer-term needs.,,
A WHO survey has found that access to HIV medicines has been severely impacted by COVID-19. Seventy-three,,
countries have warned that they are at risk of stock-outs of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines as a result of the,,
"COVID-19 pandemic, according to the survey conducted ahead of the International AIDS Society’s biannual",,
conference.,,
The WHO Regional Office for America urges countries to continue the fight against malaria during the COVID-,,
"19 pandemic, especially among vulnerable communities. In the Americas, 138 million people live in areas at risk",,
"of malaria, and some 765 000 cases and around 340 deaths were reported in 2018.",,
In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below we present an update from the WHO Information Network for Epidemics,,
(EPI-WIN) who have been holding a conference on exploring new interventions to tackle the infodemic.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,11 500 302 cases (172 512),535 759 deaths (3 419)
Africa,382 563 cases (12 635),7 139 deaths (165)
Americas,5 915 551 cases (94 711),266 736 deaths (1 712)
Eastern Mediterranean,1 187 620 cases (16 900),28 102 deaths (536)
Europe,2 809 848 cases (18 688),200 651 deaths (413)
South-East Asia,974 389 cases (26 870),25 619 deaths (583)
Western Pacific,229 590 cases (2 708),7 499 deaths (10)

"Subject in Focus: Developing trans-disciplinary science: infodemiology, the"
science behind infodemic management
“We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.”
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security conference, 15 February 2020"
"Addressing the infodemic, that is, an over-abundance of"
information on COVID-19 is a crucially important part of
"responding to the pandemic. On 7-8 April, the WHO"
Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) held a two-
"day, online global consultation to crowdsource ideas on"
infodemic management from an interdisciplinary group
of experts and over 1 300 participants. The meeting
produced a WHO framework for managing the COVID19
"infodemic and 50 action points, and committed to a"
follow-up consultation to explore science and evidence
"for new infodemic interventions, gathering insights and"
approaches from as wide a range of relevant disciplines
as possible.
This second scientific consultation opened with a public
"meeting on 29 June, followed by an invitation-only"
scientific conference and a series of remote consultations
"and parallel discussions between expert teams that will run throughout July, ending with a public webinar on"
21 July at which the findings of these discussions will be presented (register for the public webinar here).
The public meeting generated record-breaking attendance: there were 7 862 total connections to the video
"conferencing platform on which it was held, with a further 3 300 views of the parallel livestream of the event"
"— over 11 000 connections in total. 11 of the talks are available online, along with the programme and"
graphic summaries of talks.
"David Nabarro, WHO COVID-19 Special Envoy, set the tone, emphasizing the importance of empathy during"
"health emergencies and stressing the need to understand individual and community perspectives, and to"
"centre the outbreak and infodemic response on their needs. Saad Omer of Yale University, USA, then"
highlighted the cognitive aspects of misinformation and what social science research tells us about the best
"approaches in a “fact-resistant world.” Rustam Haydarov, UNICEF Communication for Development Polio"
"Lead, painted a picture of that resistance in real life, with the sobering example of a real-world infodemic"
"catalysed by a fake video that devastated parents’ vaccine confidence in oral polio vaccine in Peshawar,"
"Pakistan. Harry Sufehmi, founder of Mafindo, a hoax-busting civil society organization in Indonesia, gave an"
oral history of Mafindo’s 80 000-strong crowd-sourced efforts to fact check and push back against
"misinformatio. Claire Wardle of First Draft, an organization working to empower people with resilience"
"against misinformation, provided practical tips on how to talk with family members and friends who spread"
"misinformation: “don’t mute your uncles.” In the final session, Catherine Gicheru reflected on Kenya’s"
"COVID-19 infodemic, and how misinformation is only part of the problem: too much information of any kind,"
"if not properly contextualized, can trigger frustration and confusion in the general public. Public trust is built"
"on transparent communication and a media landscape that amplifies accurate information. Finally, Camille"
"Francois discussed the development of an online “cartography” of the infodemic, attempting to understand"
"the channels through which misinformation is spread, and how different social networks offer important"
clues for infodemic response planning.

People joined the meeting from all around the world: in the online polls and Q&A sessions held in parallel
"with the talks, there were participants from every WHO region and 158 different countries and territories."
"There was broad professional representation as well, with respondents spread across a wide range of sectors"
"—such participation was encouraging, given how many of the speakers emphasised the crucial importance of"
a multidisciplinary approach to infodemic response.
"At the end of the pre-conference, poll results suggested that the consultation had increased listeners’"
knowledge of infodemic management.

WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,
here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,

repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",

Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification isbased on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing degrees of,
transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest,
category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
