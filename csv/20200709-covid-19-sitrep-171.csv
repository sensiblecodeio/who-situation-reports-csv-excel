Subject in Focus: WHO COVID-19 support to Africa
"As of 7 July, there have been 493 131 cases of COVID-19 and 11 643 deaths reported from the"
African continent – a 25% increase in cases and 18% increase in deaths over the past week.
WHO is working closely with Ministries of Health and other partners in the African region to
support the strengthening of essential health services in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHO continues to advise and support countries to strengthen both emergency and routine
health services and to maintain influenza surveillance and other disease control strategies.
"As countries begin to reopen borders and resume air travel, including commercial flights,"
"WHO urges governments to take effective measures, including entry and exit screenings and"
"the practising of hand hygiene, cough etiquette and physical distancing measures, to mitigate"
the risk of a surge in COVID-19 transmission due to the resumption of commercial flights and
airport operations.
"After initial delays in delivering medical supplies for the COVID-19 response, tthe reopening of"
air spaces and increased availability of commercial flights in recent weeks have been a critical
"factor in facilitating shipments and the delivery of personal protective equipment, diagnostic"
tests and biomedical equipment.
"Over the coming weeks, WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) is preparing to ship"
"nearly 47 million items of personal protective equipment, including medical masks,"
"examination gloves, gowns, face shields and goggles to countries across Africa."
WHO is also seeing progress in the procurement of diagnostic tests through a purchasing
"consortium comprising WHO, UNICEF and the Global Fund. In recent weeks, the consortium"
has begun deliveries of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to approximately 130 countries.
"More than 420 000 PCR tests have been delivered to Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,"
"Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia,"
"Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda, Zambiaand Zimbabwe."
"An additional 626 000 tests are presently in transit to 25 countries, and 910 582 tests are"
awaiting shipment to 42 countries.
"More than 195 000 sample collection kits also have been delivered to 25 countries, and an"
additional 866 700 kits are in transit to 37 countries.
"To date, 2522 oxygen concentrators have been shipped to 26 countries and an additional 700"
are being prepared for shipment to 30 countries.
"WHO continues to provide operational and technical design support, upon the request of"
"governments and UN partner agencies, to establish Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI)"
treatment facilities in Africa and other regions. In collaboration with a network of architects
"and engineers, WHO has assisted 15 countries in setting up SARI treatment centres to"
support the COVID-19 response. The OSL HealthTech unit continues to accept requests for
technical assistance via the HealthTech Help Desk (reachable by email at

"oslhealthtech@who.int). Current projects in Africa include facilities in Mozambique, Burkina"
"Faso, Gambia and Chad."

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
•,"Update: 9 July 2020, Spain: Data distribution and dates of initial reported cases and"
,deaths adjusted to align with updated information from national authorities and
,regional office. Cumulative cases and deaths remain unaffected.
