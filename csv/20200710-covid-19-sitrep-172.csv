Situation Report – 172,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 10 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros acknowledged how civil society has played a critical role in responding to this,,
"pandemic by highlighting the needs of the most vulnerable, fighting for an equitable response, and",,
"holding decision-makers to account, in his address to a webinar on “civil society engagement in COVID-19",,
"response at national and local levels”, organised by WHO’s Health Partnerships department.",,
"The burden of COVID-19 is overwhelming fragile health systems in Africa, although the accelerating trend of",,
"increasing cases is not uniformly distributed across the region. WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso",,
"Moeti emphasized that “if countries continue to strengthen key public health measures such as testing, tracing",,
"contacts and isolating cases, we can slow down the spread of the virus to a manageable level.”",,
"WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge urged countries to stand firm and stay focused on",,
what we know works to hold the virus at bay; step in swiftly at the first sign of local surges; and sign up to be,,
part of a new culture of health during the summer months.,,
Today we include two reports in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below. The first summarizes key points on the updated,,
scientific brief on what we currently know about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The second provides an,,
overview of a virtual meeting that was held to share experiences and lessons learnt in COVID-19 preparedness,,
and response at points of entry in Central Africa.,,

Subject in Focus: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection,
prevention precautions,
"On 9 July 2020, WHO updated the scientific brief on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes",
"COVID-19. This replaces a previous version of the scientific brief, published on 29 March 2020.",
"As the spread of the virus continues to intensify around the world, we are gaining more knowledge as to",
how and when the virus is able to spread between people. This is important in order to continuously,
ensure that the most effective measures to suppress transmission of the virus and prevent associated,
illness and death are used.,
"Below, we provide the key points of the brief. The full scientific brief and a Q&A are available online.",
Key points of the brief,
Main findings,
•,"Understanding how, when and in what types of settings SARS-CoV-2 spreads between people is"
,critical to develop effective public health and infection prevention measures to break chains of
,transmission.
•,Current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people
,"through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as"
,"saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when"
,"an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings."
•,Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in healt care settings where specific medical
,"procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, generate very small droplets called aerosols."
,Some outbreak reports related to indoor crowded spaces have suggested the possibility of
,"aerosol transmission, combined with droplet transmission, for example, during choir practice, in"
,restaurants or in fitness classes.
•,"Respiratory droplets from infected individuals can also land on objects, creating fomites"
,(contaminated surfaces). As environmental contamination has been documented by many
,"reports, it is likely that people can also be infected by touching these surfaces and touching their"
,"eyes, nose or mouth before cleaning their hands."
•,"Based on what we currently know, transmission of COVID-19 is primarily occurring from people"
,"when they have symptoms, and can also occur just before they develop symptoms, when they"
,are in close proximity to others for prolonged periods of time. While someone who never
,"develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs"
,and more research is needed in this area.
•,Urgent high-quality research is needed to elucidate: the relative importance of different
,transmission routes; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating
,procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur; the settings and risk factors for
,superspreading events; and the extent of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.
How to prevent transmission,
The over-arching aim of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 is to control COVID-,
19 by suppressing transmission of the virus and preventing associated illness and death. To the best of,
"our understanding, the virus is primarily spread through contact and respiratory droplets. Under some",
circumstances airborne transmission may occur (such as when aerosol generating procedures are,

"conducted in healthcare settings or potentially, in indoor crowded poorly ventilated settings elsewhere).",
More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their actual significance for,
transmission of COVID-19.,
"To prevent transmission, WHO recommends a comprehensive set of measures including:",
•,"Identify suspect cases as quickly as possible, test, and isolate all cases (infected people) in"
,appropriate facilities;
•,Identify and quarantine all close contacts of infected people and test those who develop
,symptoms so that they can be isolated if they are infected and require care;
•,"Use fabric masks in specific situations, for example, in public places where there is community"
,"transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not"
,possible;
•,Use of contact and droplet precautions by health workers caring for suspected and confirmed
,"COVID-19 patients, and use of airborne precautions when aerosol generating procedures are"
,performed;
•,"Continuous use of a medical mask by health workers and caregivers working in all clinical areas,"
,during all routine activities throughout the entire shift;
•,"At all times, practise frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing when possible, and respiratory"
,"etiquette; avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with"
,"poor ventilation; wear fabric masks when in closed, over-crowded spaces to protect others; and"
,ensure good environmental ventilation in all closed settings and appropriate environmental
,cleaning and disinfection.
WHO carefully monitors the emerging evidence about this critical topic and will update this scientific,
brief as more information becomes available.,

Sharing experiences and lessons learnt in COVID-19 preparedness and
response at points of entry in Central African countries
"Earlier this month, the WHO Regional Office for Africa, through the Emergency Response Programme hub in"
"Dakar, Senegal, organized a series of virtual workshops to share experiences and lessons learnt in"
"preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Central Africa, and to strengthen cross-border"
collaboration. The webinars were conducted in partnership with the International Organization for Migration
"(IOM), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Economic Committee of Central African State"
"(ECCAS), and the Organization de Coordination pour la Lutte contre les Endemie en Afrique Central (OCEAC)."
The objectives of the workshops were to: update participants from countries and partner organizations on
recent developments in the COVID-19 response at Points of Entry (PoE); share country experiences in the
"implementation of COVID-19 preparedness and response at PoE; identify gaps in IHR core capacities, mainly"
at PoE; and agree on next steps to strengthen Member State cross-border collaboration.
"The workshops were attended by 99 participants from nine Central African countries including: Burundi,"
"Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea,"
"Gabon and Sao Tome and Principe, and international and regional partners."
Theregional strategy for COVID-19 preparedness and response was established in June with strong political
"commitment from Central African states. At the workshops, participants provided an update and reported"
"that all countries have carried out COVID-19 preparedness and response activities, put in place active case-"
"finding systems at PoE, and activated cross-border collaboration mechanisms. Participants also talked about"
"opportunities for preparedness and response funding, expressed technical needs for country support,"
"identified challenges, and described some of the lessons learnt over the past six months."
"Many countries are conducting entry screening and laboratory testing at PoE, have instituted quarantine"
"measures at home or in quarantine facilities, and are monitoring in-coming travellers using community"
"surveillance systems. On the whole, COVID-19 cross-border collaboration mechanisms have been built on"
already existing bi-lateral and/or multi-lateral cross-border collaboration schemes. Some countries are also
reactivating polio cross-border collaboration mechanisms to assist with COVID-19 preparedness and
"response. However there have been major challenges, including the lack of human and financial resources"
and constrained infrastructure capacities.
WHO will continue to support Member States and partners to reinforce PoE capacity. Some countries have
indicated that they are planning to conduct training and simulation exercises to strengthen their PoE
capacities. A technical report of these meetings will be disseminated shortly. A comprehensive regional
strategy for cross-border collaboration based on data shared during these workshops will be developed as
the next step following these meetings.

document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in,,,,
"a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here and,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its",
"authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps",
"represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and",
areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.",
[1] All references to Kosovo shouldbe understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated",
"otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and",
repatriated cases.,
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
i Transmission classification isbased on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are,
reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing degrees of,
transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest,
category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata",
• None,
