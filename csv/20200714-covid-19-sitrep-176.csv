Situation Report – 176,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 14 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
"The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published yesterday,",,
"estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and",,
by nearly 60 million in the past five years. The report forecasts the COVID-19 pandemic could tip,,
over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020.,,
"In South Sudan, WHO and the Ministry of Health are working to address stigma and fear, which",,
are proving to be major barriers to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.,,
A new report from WHO highlights that violence and injuries are a leading cause of death in the,,
"WHO European Region, accounting for almost 500 000 deaths a year. Evidence shows that",,
"violence can increase during and in the aftermath of disease outbreaks, particularly affecting",,
"women, children and older people. WHO has also produced guidance specifically addressing",,
violence against women.,,
The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) has launched a new webinar series to,,
manage infodemics through effective risk communication and community engagement. This is,,
discussed in today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ below.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,

Subject in Focus: Infodemics Management: Communicating,
uncertainty in the context of re-opening societies,
The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) has launched a new webinar series to,
manage infodemics through effective risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).,
This series aims to build practical skills for regional and country responders. The first in the,
"series, co-facilitated by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, dealt with communicating",
uncertainty during implementation and easing of public health and social measures (PHSM),
during COVID-19.,
"Particularly during the early stages of public health emergencies, there are many unknowns",
and a high demand for fact-based information. The bigger a public health emergency is and the,
"longer it lasts, the more unknowns there are likely to be. COVID-19 is a new disease that is",
"affecting countries in different ways at different times, as well as affecting individuals with",
diverse risks. Implementation and easing of PHSM have highlighted the acute need to manage,
uncertainty through communication and engagement of communities. This webinar identified,
"challenges of uncertainty related to the re-opening period, identified evidence-based RCCE",
"tactics to meet these challenges, and highlighted examples of RCCE tactics used in countries.",
The interactive session included 250 individuals from 73 countries and 184 organizations.,
"During online polls, respondents reported that the main factor leading to confusion was",
various organizations provided conflicting information or recommendations about COVID-19.,
"To avoid the perception that a change in recommendations is a result of error, organizations",
"should set expectations for change, signal changes as they occur, and time- and date-stamp",
products. Coordination also plays an important role in minimizing confusion. Coordination in,
"communication can best occur by ensuring that partners communicate the same messages,",
"coordinate releases of information, explain discrepancies between messages and build",
confidence in the expertise of all responding agencies.,
This will be an ongoing series and will include topics such as:,
•,Influencing Risk Perception through RCCE
•,Creating New Norms and Sustaining Behavior Change
•,Inclusion of Civil Society in Emergency Operations Planning and Response

disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
