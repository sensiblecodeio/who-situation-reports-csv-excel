has been leading the COVID-19 response in refugee centers in Serbia.,,
"The Director of the WHO Regional Office for the Americas, Dr Carissa F. Etienne, discusses how",,
countries in the Americas are pooling their efforts to ensure access to treatments and,,
"vaccines for COVID-19. Under WHO’s Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, the COVAX facility",,
will negotiate access with the producers of all COVID-19 candidate vaccines that show,,
promising results.,,

Subject in Focus: COVID-19 Supply Chain System – Progress Update
"With the resumption of commercial flights and air travel, WHO, through the COVID-19 Supply"
"Chain System, has reported increased deliveries of critical medical supplies for the COVID-19"
response to countries facing the greatest need. These supplies include personal protective
"equipment (PPE), diagnostics and biomedical equipment."
Personal Protective Equipment
"Working with the World Food Programme (WFP), which is running warehouse and transport"
"operations for the COVID-19 Supply Chain System, WHO has increased deliveries of PPE –
including medical masks, respirator masks, goggles, face shields, gowns and gloves - from 5.5"
million to 50.4 million pieces over the past month.
"Moving forward, nearly 201 million pieces of PPE will be shipped to 138 countries across all"
six WHO regions. These numbers include 100 million medical masks and 1 million
respirator masks donated by the Jack Ma Foundation.
"Nearly 20 million pieces of PPE have now been shipped to the Region of the Americas,"
currently the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further 70 million pieces of PPE will
be shipped over the coming weeks.
WHO is now prioritizing the shipment of 46.4 million pieces of PPE to 52 countries in Africa
over the coming weeks.

Diagnostics
"Through the diagnostics purchasing consortium, WHO, UNICEF and the Global Fund have"
procured close to 6 million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and 5.2 million sample
collection kits from a number of manufacturers to increase testing capacity in countries.
"To date, 3.1 million PCR tests and 1.7 sample collection kits have been shipped to 137"
countries across all WHO regions.
Bio-medical Equipment
Approximately US$19 million of bio-medical equipment – comprising 14 000 oxygen
"concentrators, 9 700 pulse oximeters and 4 700 patient monitors – have been purchased"
through the Clinical Care Consortium.
"Of WHO’s initial purchase of 4 000 oxygen concentrators, 3 950 concentrators have been"
shipped to 36 countries that have had the greatest difficulty accessing these life-saving
supplies for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. An additional 10 000 oxygen
concentrators were purchased in June and will be prepared for shipment upon arrival to the
WFP warehouse in China.
COVID-19 Supply Portal
"Since the launch of the COVID-19 Supply Portal, 81 countries have submitted 351 requests for"
supplies with a total estimated value of US$ 174.6 million.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
