(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 178,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 16 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
75 countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those,,
"of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee",,
"rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. The goal of COVAX is to",,
"deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or",,
WHO prequalification.,,
"WHO and UNICEF have warned of a decline in vaccinations, due to disruptions in delivery",,
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore noted that,,
“COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge” and stressed that,,
"further impact on vaccine coverage needs to be avoided, otherwise there is a risk of exchanging",,
one crisis for another.,,
"While the world races to find a vaccine to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO looks back on",,
all that vaccines have achieved for humanity.,,
"In today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ we describe the WHO Unity Study protocols, developed to better",,
understand the characteristics of the COVID-19 virus and the disease it causes.,,
Thank you for reading the WHO COVID-19 Situation Report! We would greatly appreciate any,,
feedback and suggestions you may have on these reports via a short anonymous survey.,,

Subject in Focus: Unity studies: Early epidemiological investigations
for COVID-19
"The identification of any new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,"
"is accompanied by many unknowns. Six months into the pandemic, there are certain"
"characteristics of the virus and the disease it causes that remain unclear, particularly its ability"
to spread in the human population and its virulence. To enhance understanding of the
"characteristics of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and the disease it causes, WHO has"
"developed a series of early epidemiological protocols, the WHO Unity studies. These protocols"
"enable analysis of the local context, as well as comparison across different settings."
The six currently available WHO Unity study protocols help countries to understand infection
"amongst close contacts of cases, health workers, or members of households; to understand"
the extent of infection in the population; and to determine the presence of the virus on
different surfaces and environments. The results of these studies help countries to inform
public health and social measures to limit further spread of the virus.
"To date, 47 countries have implemented at least one of the Unity study protocols. An"
additional 46 countries have expressed their intent to implement them. More than half of the
"countries implementing the protocols (55%) are low- and middle-income countries, providing"
an invaluable tool for enhanced surveillance and research equity.
"WHO supports countries to develop and implement country-specific protocols, support"
"selection of laboratory tests, and ensure comparability of results between countries. WHO has"
also procured and delivered laboratory tests to countries that have begun to implement at
least one of the studies. This represents 35 820 laboratory tests being sent to 12 low- and
"middle-income countries, with further tests to be sent to other countries in the coming"
months. The use of the same laboratory tests across study sites will ensure that the results
from different sites can be compared.
Two protocols are currently being developed in collaboration with technical partners. One will
enable understanding of the extent of infection in schools and other educational institutions.
"The other will address COVID-19 in closed settings, which include long term care facilities,"
"food processing plants, prisons, military barracks, and community venues."

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative",,,,
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no,,,,
period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any
"country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or"
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which
"there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the"
administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that
"are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are"
distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
