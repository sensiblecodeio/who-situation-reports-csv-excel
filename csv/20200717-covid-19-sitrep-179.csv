Subject in Focus: Additional health measures on international,
traffic,
"As of 10 July 2020, 192 out of 196 States Parties to the International Health Regulations",
(IHR 2005) reported additional health measures that significantly interfere with international,
"travel as defined under Article 43 ofthe IHR. Since 6 February 2020, WHO has shared",
"this information on a weekly basis through the Event Information Site, a secure platform",
accessible by national IHR focal points and United Nations agencies.,
The majority of measures taken by Member States relate to the denial of entry of,
"passengers, followed by flight suspensions, visa restrictions, border closures and",
quarantine measures. 75 countries have sent official notifications to WHO to communicate,
"the implementation or lifting of measures, as well as the public health rationale. From the",
"official reports received by WHO, these measures have been implemented within the",
context of a comprehensive set of interventions aimed at limiting the rapid spread of the,
disease that could overburden the country’s healthcare system and its response capacity.,
"During the last 3 weeks, at least 46 countries have started to lift or partially lift some of",
"the measures, based on risk assessment informed by multiple risk factors.",
The Temporary Recommendations to States Parties on additional health measures which,
were issued following the 3rd meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on 30 April 2020,
include:,
•,"Avoid restrictions on international transport of food, medical and other essential"
,supplies and permit the safe movement of essential personnel required for an
,effective pandemic response;
•,Implement appropriate travel measures with consideration of their public health
,"benefits, including entry and exit screening, education of travellers on responsible"
,"travel behavior, case finding, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, by"
,incorporating evidence on the potential role of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
,transmission;
•,"Implement and monitor case finding and contact tracing of travellers, using digital"
,tools where appropriate;

•,"Continue to review travel and trade measures based on regular risk assessments,"
,"transmission patterns at origin and destination, cost-benefit analysis, evolution of the"
,"pandemic, and new knowledge of COVID-19;"
•,Engage in global efforts to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 in managing
,maritime vessels;
•,Not implement trade restrictions beyond those considered to be of public health
,importance in accordance with relevant international agreements;
•,Continue to provide appropriate public health rationale to WHO for additional health
,measures in accordance with IHR.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus,,,,
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting"
"practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst"
"others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and"
"death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia"
"and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
"Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case"
"definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and"
"errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases."
Other*: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such"
data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This

will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details,
"become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days,",
graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see,
