and migrants. To assess the public health and social impact of the COVID-19,,
"pandemic on refugees and migrants, WHO and partners are conducting a global study",,
called ‘ApartTogether’. You can participate through a survey currently being conducted.,,
"To combat misconceptions about COVID-19 in Nigeria, WHO and the Nigerian",,
government are scaling up strategies to demystify COVID-19 by working with traditional,,
"leaders. The aim is to empower traditional leaders, who command great respect, to",,
participate in on-going sensitization efforts and to sustain the strategy by letting,,

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus,,,,
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death,,,,
is available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be
"expected between information products published by WHO, national public health"
"authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off"
"times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to"
"continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting"
"practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst"
"others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and"
"death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level."
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United
"Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia"
"and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
* Asmall number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data
table.† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such"
data as negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This
will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details
"become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days,"

graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see,
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.,
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information,
becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within a,
country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases"
,not linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab
,surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the
,country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
•,"Note, United States of America: no updates were received today prior to the data"
,"cutoff time, thus regional and global totals for new cases and deaths are substantially"
,reduced. The figures will be adjusted when data are available.
