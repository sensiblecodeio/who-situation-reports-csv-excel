Subject in Focus 1: COVID-19 and indigenous peoples in the region of the
Americas
"There are approximately 370 to 500 million indigenous peoples worldwide, across 90 countries 1 ."
"Most indigenous peoples may experience health inequalities, including in access to health services, quality"
"preventive and curative health services and access to water and sanitation. Moreover, they may also"
"experience a high burden of poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions and non-communicable"
diseases which can make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its severe effects.
"The higher risks experienced by indigenous peoples, as well as their respective challenges, needs, and"
"historical contexts, have led WHO to launch a number of initiatives in the COVID-19 pandemic response,"
"including technical cooperation, evidence-based guidance and recommendations that underscores the"
need for intercultural approaches and equity.
"This need is greatly felt in the indigenous communities in the Region of the Americas, particularly in the"
light of the recent increase in COVID-19 cases and related deaths. The WHO Regional Office of the
Americas/PAHO issued the Epidemiological Alert: COVID-19 among indigenous peoples in the Americas
"(15 July 2020), urging Member States to intensify efforts to prevent further spread of infection within"
"these communities, ensure adequate access to healthcare services and strengthen case management"
using culturally appropriate approaches.
"In view of the urgent situation in the Amazonian region, PAHO and the Coordinator of Indigenous"
Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) have agreed to work together to step up the fight against
"COVID-19 in the region. COICA includes indigenous organizations from the Peruvian jungle, eastern Bolivia,"
"the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Colombian Amazon, and the Brazilian Amazon."
"On 15 July 2020, a joint statement signed by both organizations urged countries to strengthen health care"
"services in the Amazon through the provision of human resources, supplies and medical devices, including"
"COVID-19 confirmatory tests, and treatments and vaccines when they are available. The statement"
highlights those populations living in voluntary isolation. PAHO and COICA also urged countries to
"coordinate a joint response that is adapted to the social and cultural reality, and specific needs of the"
"population and area, particularly border areas."
"As part of the agreement, a regional forum will be planned to bring together the agencies and"
international organizations working in the area to coordinate the response while drawing attention to the
reality of COVID-19 in indigenous peoples and nationalities of the Amazon.
The need to reduce vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and its severe outcomes is also highlighted in a guidance
"document “Considerations on Indigenous Peoples, Afro-Descendants, and Other Ethnic Groups during the"
"COVID-19 Pandemic”. The document identifies challenges, concerns and gaps in the COVID-19 response"
"among indigenous peoples in the region and offers recommendations to mitigate these gaps, aimed at"
"governments, community leaders, health care workers and indigenous peoples are to mitigate these"
identified gaps.
"1UNDP, 2019"

The document highlights the following key considerations to be followed when responding to COVID-19,
among indigenous peoples:,
•,"Ensure public health information and communication are accessible through culturally appropriate,"
,quality communication campaigns
•,Forge agreements and participatory decision making between indigenous peoples and health service
,networks in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in communities. Organize and participate in
,intercultural dialogues to inform members of the community about the measures to be adopted with
,respect to COVID-19.
•,Include an ethnicity variable in health registries to generare important information for tailoring COVID-
,19 interventions to the needs of different populations.
•,Promote intersectoral action to tackle the social determinants of health that affect COVID-19 response
,and prevention.

Subject in Focus 2: Update on partner coordination
Emergency medical teams (EMT)
"As of 17 July 2020, the EMT network has facilitated a total of 33 international deployments, over half of"
which are currently ongoing.
"In the African Region, The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) is supporting operations in"
"Senegal, Burkina Faso and Cameroon. Malteser Germany have finalized assessments of COVID-19
operational support needs in Yaounde and Douala in Cameroon. In addition, the EMT network continues
to operate and support operations in Burkina Faso, Chad, Senegal, Ghana, South Sudan, and Zambia."

"In the European Region, the EMT Regione Piemonte (Italy) has completed a two week mission to support"
"the national surge capacity in Armenia. To ensure continuity, International Search and Rescue (ISAR)
Germany have arrived to continue this work in country."
"In the Region of the Americas, national operations continue to be critical to the response, with almost"
180 EMTs deployed using the EMT methodology. Elément de Sécurité Civile Rapide d'intervention
Médicale ESCRIM France continues to operate in French Guiana. The efforts of the deployed EMT teams
"are focused on the direct clinical care of patients, surge capacity and technical support to adapt triage"

"and isolation areas, inpatient wards and overall re-organization of hospitals to assist the COVID-19",
response.,
The EMT network has provided more than 1800 beds in Chile to increase capacity at health facilities; it,
"has also provided 1637 beds in Bolivia, and 1422 beds in Peru. These beds were provided through",
"the EMT Network. As of 17 July 2020, a total of 8330 beds have been managed or supported by the EMT",
network in the region.,
More than 150 existing facilities have been repurposed for treatment using the EMT technical standards.,
"Finally, coordination structures have been supported in 57 countries with EMT focal points, senior staff",
and experts mobilized from the roster of members trained in EMT coordination and mentorship,
methodology.,
"In the Western Pacific Region, the New Zealand Medical Assistance Team (NZMAT), together with the",
"EMT Secretariat and partners, piloted a remote exercise management system which enables EMTs to",
conduct remote simulation exercises. This pilot will help to build and inform the future remote exercise,
simulations for experts and teams in the network who are currently responding to COVID-19.,
The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN),
"GOARN partners and networks continue to provide technical advice across all health operation pillars,",
"particularly clinical management, Infection Prevention and Control, laboratory and risk communication",
and community engagement (RCCE).,
"As of 17 July 2020, 585 offers of support from 50 GOARN Partner institutions have been received, 85",
have been deployed. Operational factors that have a major impact on the deployment of international,
support include heavy travel restrictions and quarantine requirements related to international travel.,
"WHO, GOARN partners and stakeholders continue to collaborate on the rollout and implementation",
"of Go.Data. Go.Data is a field platform for collecting and analyzing key data for case investigations, for",
contact tracing and follow-up; and for generating chains of transmission.,
"The Go.Data team has responded to over 450 requests, and is supporting over 55 projects worldwide to",
"implement Go.Data. The team continues to conduct virtual trainings and briefings, provide user",
"support for epidemiology, analytics, interoperability and IT. In addition, recently launched Go.Data",
community of practice is becoming the main channel of communication within Go.Data users and a,
resource for latest information and documentation.,
Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE),
The main outputs from the RCCE collaboration include:,
•,"RCCE strategy is being updated to address next 6 months of the response, aligned to Strategic"
,Preparedness and Response Plan and Global Humanitarian Response Plan.
•,"Three broad areas of misinformation, rumors and concerns have been identified based on"
,"community feedback and media monitoring data: treatment options, impending second wave"
,and modes of transmission and protective behaviours and use of masks.
•,RCCE Collective Service Governance and functioning has been finalized and endorsed by the
,"steering committee. GOARN will provide strategic, operational and technical support"
,"and guidance, as well as surge capacity and strong links with the training and social science"
,research networks.
•,"As part of a phased approach, two regional collective service hubs in African continent (West /"
,Central and Eastern / Southern) are being strengthened with dedicated staff. This is building on

,"the strong coordination systems creates. 4Ws- Who, What, Where, Why- mapping on going in"
,both regions.
•,The interagency Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) technical working
,groups in East and Southern and West and Central Africa has developed new guidance developed
,on community led interventions for COVID 19.
•,A brief to inform the best approach to RCCE for contact tracing brief is being developed as a
,follow-up to WHO/GOARN contact tracing consultation.
•,Ongoing work on community perceptions to contact tracing in new survey being conducted in 27
,countries by Imperial college (UK) and WHO.
•,RCCE webinar- ‘Listening to community feedback: a discussion on how to better close the loop
,and inform action’ will take place on 5 August at 11:00 AM Geneva time.
Additional information is available on the GOARN knowledge platform for COVID-19 to share resources,
from partners and other stakeholders.,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness,,,,
and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or of",
"its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on",
"maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"

,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
•,"Update 20 July 2020, Kyrgyzstan: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: count of"
,number of cases adjusted to 1548 and count of number of deaths adjusted to 80 on 19 July.
•,"Erratum 20 July 2020, United States of America: Counts adjusted retrospectively to align with national"
,authorities: added 74 354 cases and 917 deaths on 19 July.
