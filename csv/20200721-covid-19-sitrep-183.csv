Subject in Focus: The first global WHO infodemiology conference - Building the,
science behind managing infodemics,
"In April, WHO held an online global",
consultation that produced a WHO,
framework for managing the COVID-19,
"infodemic, along with 50 action points, one of",
which was to hold the first WHO,
Infodemiology Conference: a trans-,
disciplinary consultation to gather insights,
and approaches from as wide a range of,
"relevant scientific fields as possible,",
establishing a glossary and research,
framework for infodemic management.,
"A public webinar on 29 June set the context,",
generating record-breaking attendance—over 11 000 online connections. This was followed by an,
"invitation-only scientific conference consisting of a plenary session in early July, then a series of parallel",
"discussions among expert teams that ran until a closing plenary on 16 July, at which the results of those",
"discussions were presented. A final, public webinar was held on 21 July, to present the outcomes of",
these discussions to the public.,
"Along with strengthening the foundations of a new infodemiology discipline, the broader aims of this",
conference were to:,
•,understand the multidisciplinary nature of infodemic management;
•,"identify current examples and tools to understand, measure and control infodemics;"
•,build a public health research agenda to direct focus and investment in this emerging field; and
•,establish a community of practice and research.
"By the 16 July closing plenary, a draft research agenda had been shaped from these discussions,",
organised across five action areas:,
1.,Measure and monitor the impact of infodemics during health emergencies
2.,Detect and understand spread and impact of infodemics
3.,Respond and deploy interventions that protect and mitigate the infodemic and its harmful effects
4.,Evaluate infodemic interventions and strengthen resilience of individuals and communities to
,infodemics
5.,Strengthen systems for infodemic management in health emergencies.
A community of research and practice is being built to encourage the necessary cross-disciplinary,
"connections, encourage collaboration, build the required repositories of tools and resources, and track",
"the implementation of this agenda. Finally, an infodemiology glossary is being created to standardize the",
"language as a basis for a new field, along with a competencies framework for an infodemiology skillset —",
ultimately enabling capacity-building for the new field.,

WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
* A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table. † Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
