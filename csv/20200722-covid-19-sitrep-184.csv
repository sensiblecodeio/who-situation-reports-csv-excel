(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 184,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 22 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
Approximately one third of people in the Americas are at increased risk of developing severe,,
"COVID-19 illness due to underlying health conditions. To help confront this, the WHO Regional",,
"Office of the Americas/PAHO, in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical",,
"Medicine, have developed a new data model that provides a more accurate picture of the",,
prevalence of underlying health conditions in the Americas.,,
WHO works with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education to serve the people of Islamic,,
"Republic of Iran to deliver vital equipment and medicines, train health workers and raise",,
awareness in communities across the country. Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is a key,,
component of clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. WHO has delivered 16 CT scan machines,,
to strengthen the Islamic Republic of Iran’s emergency response to COVID-19.,,
"WHO has chronicled the experience of Dr Altynai Karakhoishiyeva, an obstetrician-gynecologist",,
"working in Municipal Maternity Hospital No. 1 in Almaty, Kazakhstan. She has worked at this",,
"hospital throughout the pandemic, when it became a place of quarantine for pregnant women",,
suspected of having COVID-19.,,
WHO is helping redesign hospitals to ensure and optimise mitigation measures against,,
"COVID-19. In Italy, WHO is providing advice on how to create alternative routes in hospitals for",,
confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 as well as how to ensure better spacing in waiting,,
rooms and improve ventilation in order to minimise spread of the virus in health care settings.,,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
•,"Update 22 July 2020, Austria: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: case"
,and death counts adjusted between 17 July and 21 July.
•,"Update 22 July 2020, Belgium: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: case"
,and death counts adjusted between 3 March and 21 July.
•,"Update 22 July 2020, France: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: 12"
