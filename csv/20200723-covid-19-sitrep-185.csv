(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 185,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 23 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
In a joint effort to enhance research and development related to the use of traditional medicines for COVID-19,,
"in Africa, the WHO Regional Office for Africa and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa",,
CDC) have launched an expert advisory committee to provide independent scientific advice and support to,,
"countries on the safety, efficacy and quality of traditional medicine therapies.",,
WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge has signed an agreement for a new centre of,,
"excellence and visited Gaziantep, marking 60 years of cooperation with Turkey. Dr Kluge and Dr Fahrettin Koca,",,
"Turkey’s Minister of Health, also discussed Turkey’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as improving",,
the pandemic situation in Turkey with the country’s Scientific Advisory Board for COVID-19.,,
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is one of the few countries where there have not been any COVID-19,,
"cases reported. Since early January, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has been working with the",,
government and partners to support FSM to prepare for COVID-19 with a special focus on empowering local,,
communities.,,
"WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS and the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University,",,
have jointly launched an intiative called COVID-19 Law Lab. The COVID-19 Law Lab gathers and shares legal,,
documents related to COVID-19 from over 190 countries across the world to help countries establish and,,
implement strong legal frameworks to manage the pandemic.,,
"Today, we include two reports in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below. The first provides information on the ‘Working",,
group on SARS-COV-2 genetic sequence evolution’. The second provides an update on the ‘COVID-19 Supply,,
chain system’.,,

Subject in Focus 1: Working group on SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence
evolution
"Genomic sequencing in early January 2020 in China supported the identification of SARS-CoV-2 , the"
virus that causes COVID-19 disease. The sharing of the genomic sequence on an accessible database
"enabled the rapid development, validation and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays in"
"January, which are now routinely used to diagnose COVID-19. The number of genomic sequences"
"generated and shared during the pandemic has occurred at an unprecedented speed, largely through"
"different genetic sequencing platforms, including the GISAID Initiative. As of 23 July 2020, over 70 000"
sequences are available on GISAID.
"Genomic sequence data, in combination with epidemiological and clinical data, aids the pandemic"
response and informs the public health and social measures to be used to counter the spread of the
virus. The sharing of genetic sequencing data is also important because it enables the evolution of
SARS-CoV-2 to be studied over time. Tracking genetic sequence evolution allows scientists to identify
"changes, called mutations, that may occur in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These changes are expected as"
"viruses naturally change over time. However, it is critical to understand if any mutations may result"
"in changes in the behavior of the virus, specifically changes in transmissibility, severity and/or the"
"effectiveness of countermeasures, such as future vaccines or therapeutics. In addition, changes need"
to be monitored for their impact on diagnostic tests.
"One such mutation that is currently of interest is called the “D614G” mutation, which was first"
"observed in February 2020 in a number of countries, and is now present in SARS-CoV-2 viruses that"
are widely distributed around the world. This variant has an amino acid change from Aspartate (D)
to Glycine (G) in the spike protein. The spike protein is critical to the attachment and entry of the
virus into human cells by attaching to the ACE2 receptor. It has been suggested that the “D614G”
mutation might make the virus more transmissible and research is currently ongoing to assess this.
"To coordinate efforts to identify and understand mutations in SARS-CoV-2 in a timely manner, WHO"
has established a working group on SARS-CoV-2 evolution as part of the WHO COVID-19 Reference
Laboratory Expert Network. This working group will advise and support WHO in the timely detection
"and evaluation of potentially relevant mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and where needed, advise on"
possible strategies to reduce their impact. The first meeting of the WHO Working group on SARS-
CoV-2 genetic sequence evolution was held in June 2020 and the working group continues to meet
via teleconference.

Subject in Focus 2: COVID-19 Supply Chain System – Progress Update
Accessing the most critical supplies to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak has presented particular
challenges for low- and middle-income countries with limited means to approach markets
overwhelmed by unprecedented demand.
"A collective effort by WHO, UN partner agencies, NGOs and donors has secured volumes of personal"
"protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics and clinical care equipment from manufacturers, which are"
now being delivered to 143 low- and middle-income countries.
"This pooled procurement process, coordinated by WHO, has resulted in significant increases in"
"diagnostics, PPE and clinical care equipment delivered to countries over the past month."
Diagnostics
"WHO convened the Diagnostics Consortium – comprising WHO, WFP, UNICEF, UNDP, Unitaid, UN"
"DOS, PAHO, Africa CDC, Global Fund, Global Drug Facility, World Bank, CHAI, FIND, Bill and Melinda"
Gates Foundation – in response to supply shortages that resulted from massive global demand at
"the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the past three months, the Consortium has worked to"
identify and negotiate with suppliers to secure diagnostic products to support low- and middle-
income countries.
"Through the Consortium, WHO, UNICEF and the Global Fund have procured 6.5 million polymerase"
chain reaction (PCR) tests and 5.6 million sample collection kits to date for allocation to 134
countries (Figure 1).
Figure: 1

The Consortium has also delivered nearly 2.5 million manual and automated polymerase chain,
"reaction (PCR) tests to 44 countries, with another 1 million tests currently in transit. A total of 1.1",
"million sample collection kits have been delivered to 60 countries, and nearly 1 million kits are in",
transit. Efforts are ongoing to approach manufacturers to procure additional supplies to provide,
continuing support to countries through the COVID-19 pandemic.,
The Consortium has started discussions to coordinate a procurement strategy and allocation,
criteria for Phase 2 of procurement (September to December 2020). As with Phase 1 (May to August,
"2020), efforts will remain focused on securing maximum supplies, ensuring equitable allocation and",
"deliveries across countries, and encouraging transparency in procurement and distribution of",
supplies.,
The consortium encourages countries and partners to submit diagnostic requests through the,
COVID-19 Supply Chain Portal and to include the funding source of the supplies requested.,
The Supply Chain catalogue for diagnostics has been revised to provide information to countries on,
specific products available for procurement through the Portal. Technical review of additional,
manual tests are ongoing to expand the Supply Chain catalogue to provide more options to the,
countries.,
"To explain the Phase 1 allocation, the Consortium has developed several documents, including (i)",
"Technical Diagnostics FAQs, (ii) Diagnostics Allocation FAQs, and (iii) Diagnostic test reagent",
calculator.,
Biomedical Equipment,
Biomedical equipment procured to date:,
•,"14,000 oxygen concentrators (US$ 12.4 million) of which 3960 have been shipped to 37"
,countries
•,"9,720 pulse oximeters (US$ 2.4 million)"
•,"2,925 patient monitors (US$5.5 million)"
COVID-19 Supply Portal,
"Since the launch of the COVID-19 Supply Portal, 83 countries have submitted 383 requests for",
supplies valued at US$ 163 million.,

PPE
"Since 14 July 2020, WHO has shipped an additional 11 million pieces of PPE, bringing the total"
numbers shipped to 61.4 million pieces (Figure 2). A further 190 million pieces of PPE are being
prepared in the warehouse to be shipped in the coming weeks.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
