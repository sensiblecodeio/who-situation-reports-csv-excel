Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 189,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 27 July 2020",,
Highlights,,
This Thursday it will be six months since WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of,,
International Concern. At today’s press briefing WHO Director-General Dr Tedros reiterated the basic,,
"measures that are needed to suppress transmission and save lives -- to find, isolate, test and care for cases;",,
"and trace and quarantine their contacts. “Where these measures are followed, cases go down. Where",,
"they’re not, cases go up”.",,
The Subject in Focus today highlights the Second Global Research and Innovation Forum which was,,
hosted virtually by WHO on 1 and 2 July 2020. This followed on from the first forum held in February,,
"2020. Approximately 1200 participants from nearly 100 countries convened to review the science, to",,
"establish what we know now that we didn’t know at the start of the pandemic, and to set priorities for the",,
COVID-19 research agenda.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,16 114 449 cases (254 274),646 641 deaths (5 490)
Africa,712 920 cases (16 713),11 900 deaths (192)
Americas,8 610 134 cases (150 089),337 439 deaths (3 715)
Eastern Mediterranean,1 482 315 cases (12 336),37 932 deaths (450)
Europe,3 234 043 cases (17 409),210 518 deaths (257)
South-East Asia,1 786 145 cases (53 897),40 615 deaths (829)
Western Pacific,288 151 cases (3 830),8 224 deaths (47)

"Subject in Focus: Second Global Research Forum, 1-2 July 2020",
Following on from the first Global Research and Innovation Forum hosted by WHO on 11-12,
"February, a second follow-up forum was convened virtually on 1-2 July.",
The first forum in February brought together over 350 scientists and public health experts from,
around the world to define the research priorities for COVID-19. A coordinated Global Research,
"Roadmap was developed ,using the WHO R&D Blueprint framework and based on the deliberations",
from the Forum. The research roadmap prioritized nine thematic areas of research based on agreed,
research questions and critical science gaps as they relate to COVID-19. This forum enabled thematic,
working groups to be established to carry work forward – each composed of experts led by an,
"external chair, with WHO acting as the Secretariat for each.",
"Since February, this global collaboration and coordination has been pivotal in promptly delivering",
"results and research findings to the global community. Without it, the consolidation of knowledge",
"related to the virus and disease could simply not have happened as efficiently, effectively and quickly.",
"On 1-2 July 2020, the second Global Research and Innovation Forum was held virually, allowing 1,200",
"participants from nearly 100 countries, representing all six WHO regions. An important element of",
this second Forum was to sustain the momentum generated during the February meeting within the,
"global scientific community, and to ensure regional and country office counterparts have the",
opportunity to engage and be updated on research progress for COVID-19.,
The follow-up forum took stock of the progress made; reviewed critical research findings against the,
nine thematic areas of research; discussed new emerging research questions and science gaps; and,
defined the research priorities for the remainder of the year and beyond.,
"Specifically, the forum reviewed the accumulated scientific knowledge around the following areas:",
o,Clinical characterization and the effect of support therapies in survival
o,"Transmission, severity, susceptibility, and control and mitigation measures"
o,Zoonotic sources and new animal reservoir with ability to transmit to humans
o,Viral shedding and transmission dynamics
o,Protecting health care workers and the public from the virus during the pandemic
o,Repurposing existing drugs to treat severe hospitalized cases of COVID-19
o,The social sciences of COVID-19 including the effects on mental health and others
"In addition, the forum discussed the following prioity research questions:",
o,How to continue to develop robust evidence to inform standard of care?
o,How can epidemiological studies further contribute to controlling the virus?
o,How to tailor the selection and evaluation of therapeutics to increased understanding of the
,disease?
o,How to ensure most candidate vaccines are adequately evaluated until they fail ?
o,"For clinical trials for vaccines, what study designs need to be considered?"
o,What are the key methodological considerations to achieve speed and rigour in the development of a
,vaccine?

This Forum helped to highlight that research continues to be a critical tool to inform the response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. This research is helping to save lives now and will continue to do so in the
"future. In a time of global crisis, the spotlight and the eyes of the world are on science to help control"
the current pandemic and to better safeguard our future with measures that can help prevent another
outbreak.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
