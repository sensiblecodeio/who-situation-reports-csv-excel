"WHO has published an interim guidance on Considerations for implementing mass treatment, active case-",,
finding and population-based surveys for neglected tropical diseases in the context of the COVID-19,,
"pandemic. The document proposes a two-step approach: a risk–benefit assessment, to decide if the",,
"planned neglected tropical diseases activity should proceed, and a review of a list of precautionary",,
"measures, to decide how the planned activity should be implemented.",,
Ethiopia vaccinates nearly 15 million children against measles despite COVID-19 challenges. The,,
"campaign’s target was 15 million children and it attained 96% coverage (14.4 million), showing that even",,
"with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries can continue to carry out life-saving mass vaccinations.",,
The WHO Regional Office for the Americas and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) launched the,,
“Stronger Together” campaign to assist communities in promoting mental wellbeing and positive coping,,
strategies during times of stress and crisis. The awareness campaign will run until November 2020 and,,
includes a range of promotional materials and media.,,
Today’s Subject in Focus provides an update on Infodemics management.,,

Subject in Focus: Infodemics Management – ‘The FoRCCE’ Regions helping,
Regions through Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE),
A strong network of Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) in WHO’s regional,
"offices has developed a high volume of consistent yet adaptable messages, materials and strategies.",
The network was informally named the Formidable Officers of RCCE (The FoRCCE) and has been,
supporting country preparedness under the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework,
since 2019.,
"In January 2020, the FoRCCE teamed up with WHO headquarters to share materials, messages and",
strategies related to COVID-19 that could be adapted for use in other regions. Coordination with,
"each of the regional offices meant that the network could foresee issues on the horizon, as countries",
responded to COVID-19 at different times. They could also avoid duplication of work and possible,
"confusion in messaging, while identifying gaps, myths and misinformation occurring in countries",
across the world.,
Materials developed in one region are being translated and used by others. Below are examples of,
materials created in one region and amplified around the world :,
•,the Regional Office for Africa shared its experience with community engagement;
•,the Regional Office for the Americas created an informative guide for journalists on COVID-19;
•,the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean regional office produced a home care video ;
•,the Regional Office for Europe developed a Behavioural Insights tool which is being used across
,Europe and many other countries (Figure 1);
Figure 1: Behaviour insights-tool-chart from WHO Regional Office for Europe,

•,the Regional Office for South-East Asia focused on misinformation management by developing a
,"rumour monitoring framework and rumour repository, partnering with factcheckers and"
,"amplifying facts through over 300 videos, infographics, and other material in 10 languages"
•,the Western Pacific Regional Office created a package for health care workers which contains a
,series of simplified messages and reminders for healthcare facilities in the context of COVID-19.
Several regional offices have been conducting webinars based on country needs. Topics have,
"included trust, coordination, partnering with the media, community engagement, rumours",
"management, social media, hotlines, reaching vulnerable groups remotely, behaviour change,",
"communicating the risk of large-scale community transmission, integrating risk assessment and",
"risk communication, stigma and discrimination, communicating uncertainty, ‘ensuring impact:",
"monitoring and evaluation of risk communication’, and the role of behavioral surveillance. Some of",
these webinars will soon be available for viewing at epi-win.who.int.,

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
