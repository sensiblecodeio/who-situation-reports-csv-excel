Subject in Focus: Safe Eid al Adha practices in the context of COVID-19,
"The Eid al Adha, also called Eid Qurban (“Feast of the sacrifice”) is a celebration observed by",
"Muslims worldwide, during which families and friends unite to pray and give alms, usually meat",
from animals that have been sacrificed (hence the name).,
"Festivities may last from one to a few days, and are characterized by many social and religious",
"gatherings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, precautions need to be taken to prevent transmission",
"of the virus. On 25 July 2020, WHO published interim guidance entitled Safe Eid al Adha practices in",
the context of COVID-19 that provides guidance applicable across different national contexts.,
WHO recommends that any decision on mass gatherings should be based on a careful assessment of,
all risk factors associated with the event. Guidance documents and tools have been developed to,
"this effect. Steps to be taken include risk evaluation, risk management and risk communication – the",
"latter of which has the aim of sharing with communities the rationale for the decisions taken, the",
measures applied and any residual risk.,
"Based on this risk-based approach, the decision may be taken to cancel a planned event or make it",
"virtual. If, on the contrary, it is decided to proceed with an event, key precautions should be",
"implemented, including basic measures for enforcing physical distancing of at least one metre",
"(three feet) between people at all times, frequent hand cleaning, and respiratory etiquette.",
Other recommendations relate to:,
•,"The venue, such as whether to hold the event outdoors and/or make it as short as possible;"
,"regulate the number and flow of people entering, attending and departing from the event;"
,enforce routine cleaning.
•,"Specific population groups, such as advising those who feel unwell or have symptoms suggestive"
,of COVID-19 and those at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 (older
,individuals and/or individuals with underliying medical conditions) to refrain from attending
,these gatherings.
"The slaughter of an animal is central to Eid al Adha. As such, the interim guidance also focuses on",
precautions that should be observed on these occasions. Although evidence indicates that infected,
"humans can infect other mammals, it remains unclear if the reverse can also occur. Animals that",
"have been shown to be able to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 include dogs, cats and farmed mink are",
"not typically sacrificed during Eid al Adha. Nevertheless, it is well known that several infectious",
"diseases can be transmitted at the human-animal interface. As such, countries are advised to follow",
"general precautionary measures relating to animal management, meat processing, and",
marketplaces as recommended by national and international food safety and hygiene regulations.,
"Precautions should also be applied by the faithful when distributing meat to those in need, so that",
"remembrance, charity and care for others can safely remain at the core of Eid al Adha’s celebrations",
during the COVID-19 pandemic.,
"The interim guidance is currently available in Arabic, English, French and Russian.",

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
