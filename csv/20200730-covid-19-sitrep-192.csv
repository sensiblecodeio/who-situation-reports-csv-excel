Subject in Focus – WHO COVID-19 HelpDesk: global assistance to set,
up COVID-19 care centres,
WHO has established a HelpDesk dedicated to providing technical assistance for,
"establishing COVID-19 treatment facilities at the request of Member States, WHO Country",
"and Regional offices, UN agencies and other international organizations. The WHO COVID-",
19 HelpDesk supports the design of new COVID-19 facilities and the repurposing of,
"existing buildings into self-quarantine, screening and treatment centres. Established in",
"March, the WHO COVID-19 HelpDesk has responded to 53 requests for support from 27",
different countries.,
WHO technical experts provide design and operational advice and recommendations for,
the layout of new facilities or the converting of existing structures. Design plans aim to:,
•,"Define proper pathways for medical staff, patient and visitors,"
•,"Strengthen engineering and environment controls,"
•,"Ensure adequate ventilation systems,"
•,"Designate specific areas requiring the use of personal protective equipment (PPE),"
,based on recommended risk assessments for rational use.
"In collaboration with WHO health operations and technical experts, assistance may also",
extend to providing recommendations for oxygen supply strategies and clinical care,
"equipment, as well as training for medical and non-medical personnel.",

"Most recently, the HelpDesk has begun working with the Italian Ministry of Health and the",
University of Bologna in the Emilia Romagna region to re-purpose hospitals for the post-,
acute COVID-19 phase; enabling health workers to provide care to both COVID-19 and,
"non-COVID patients, while minimizing risk of COVID-19 transmission. WHO is currently",
working with one of the largest,
hospitals in Bologna (with,
"+2000 bed capacity), to review",
and restructure the public,
health system to increase,
"resiliency, flexibility and",
responsiveness to health,

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply

*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
•,"Update 30 July 2020, UK: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: case and"
,death counts adjusted from 1 February to 29 July.
•,"Update 30 July 2020, Belgium: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities: case"
,and death counts adjusted from 7 February to 28 July.
