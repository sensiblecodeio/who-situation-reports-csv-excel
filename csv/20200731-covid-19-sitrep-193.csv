Highlights,,
"In his regular media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted the high rates of COVID-19 in long-",,
"term care facilities, drawing attention to a recently published WHO policy brief. Dr Tedros also reminded us",,
that COVID-19 is not only a disease that affects the elderly and that “young people must take the same,,
precautions to protect themselves and protect others as everyone else. They can be leaders – they should be,,
leaders and drivers of change.”,,
"During this pandemic, even the strongest health systems in the world have been overwhelmed and unable to",,
adequately provide essential health services and care for conditions not associated with COVID-19. In an,,
"address to the Virtual Symposium on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and HIV on SDG 3.3, WHO Regional",,
"Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge emphasized the need to “be on the alert to expand capacity to",,
"deal with a resurgence of COVID-19 and, at the same time, to maintain essential health services.”",,
"WHO has published interim guidance on the provision of safe water, sanitation and waste management and",,
hygienic conditions which is essential for preventing disease and for protecting human health during all,,
"infectious disease outbreaks, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,
Today’s Subject in Focus highlights new guidance on public health considerations while resuming international,,
travel.,,

Subject in Focus: Public health considerations while resuming international
travel
"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,198 countries/areas/territories have implemented measures that"
are significantly interfering with international traffic as defined under Article 43 of the International
Health Regulations (IHR 2005). Only one third of the 198 countries have provided a public health
"rationale for these measures, and only a few countries conduct and communicate regular risk"
"assessments and reviews of measures. As of 23 July 2020, only 63 of 198 countries/areas/territories"
have lifted measures that were implemented to restrict the international movement of people.
As countries consider to either gradually lift or re-introduce restrictions with the intention of controlling
"virus transmission, WHO published “Public health considerations while resuming international travel” in"
order to inform national decision-making processes. The publication advises countries to conduct risk
"assessments, as not doing so while restricting travel may have adverse effects on the overall public"
health situation.
"The multi-sectoral risk assessment should take into account country context, the local epidemiology and"
"transmission patterns, the national health and social measures to control the outbreak, and the"
"capacities of health systems in both departure and destination countries, including at points of entry."
Measures must be proportionate to the public health risks and should be regularly reassessed and
communicated to the public.
"The guidance underlines the importance of basic surveillance, isolation of cases, contact tracing and self-"
monitoring as well as risk communication and community engagement. Support for countries in defining
their needs and priorities is also provided in the form of an overview of capacities at points of entry
along with considerations for the use of digital tools and immunity certificates.

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
