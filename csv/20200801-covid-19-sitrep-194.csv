Highlights,,
The fourth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding COVID-19,,
was convened by the WHO Director-General on 31 July 2020. The Director-General declared that the outbreak,,
of COVID-19 continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The,,
recommendations from the Emergency Committee highlight the need for response efforts to continue over the,,
long term.,,
"WHO has updated the interim guidance on Water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and waste management for",,
"SARS-CoV-2. The document provides additional details on risks associated with excreta and untreated sewage,",,
"on hand hygiene, on protecting WASH workers and on supporting the continuation and strengthening of WASH",,
"services, especially in underserved areas.",,
WHO has published a draft for Target Product Profiles (TPP) for COVID-19 therapeutics. The three sets of TPPs,,
describe the preferred and minimally acceptable profiles for therapeutic agents for the treatment of those with,,
"COVID-19, ranging from mild through critically ill patients. Comments on this document are welcomed by",,
submitting a comment form. All forms should be completed with the details of the individual or organization,,
providing the comment.,,
"For World Breastfeeding Week, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to protect and promote",,
"women’s access to skilled breastfeeding counselling. This is a critical component of breastfeeding support and,",,
"amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to find innovative solutions to ensure that access to",,
these essential services is not disrupted.,,

Case definitions,,,,
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19),,,,
document which includes surveillance definitions.,,,,
Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A small number ofcountries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
