"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 3 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
WHO has published a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Progress Report. The report highlights the,,
progress made from 1 February to 30 June 2020 under the three objectives outlined in the Strategic Response,,
and Preparedness Plan: scaling up international coordination and support; scaling up country preparedness and,,
response by pillar; and accelerating research and innovation.,,
"""Immune systems are compromised by malnutrition, especially in the case of children, leaving them vulnerable",,
"to infectious diseases, including COVID-19,"" said Salah Alshaoof, a nutrition and health professional at the",,
WHO-supported therapeutic feeding centre in Yemen. WHO has provided support to 90 therapeutic feeding,,
centres in Yemen with support from Italy and other donors.,,
Robots are being used in Rwanda in the fight against COVID-19. The 5 human-size robots which were acquired,,
through a partnership between the UNDP Rwanda Accelerator Lab and the Ministry of ICT and Innovation were,,
launched in May 2020 at the Kanyinya COVID-19 Treatment Centre. As the Kigali International Airport in,,
"Rwanda will be reopened for commercial international flights from 1 August, one of the robots - Urumuri - will",,
be used to facilitate the faster screenings of passenger’s. body temperature.,,
Today we present a ‘Subject in Focus’ update summarizing how WHO and partners of the Global Outbreak,,

Subject in Focus: Supporting the COVID-19 response through the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the Global Health Cluster
"Since the beginning of January 2020, WHO and partners of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response"
"Network (GOARN) have shared information on alerts, risk assessments, collaborated on the"
"development of response plans, and provided country support. Weekly teleconferences have supported"
"the coordination and engagment of the Steering Committee, and major COVID response partners and"
stakeholders.
WHO and GOARN partners and networks include the Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and
"Response Network, Global Infection and Prevention Control Network, Emerging and Dangerous"
"Pathogens Laboratory Network and COVID laboratory networks, contact tracing network and the new"
Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) common services collective. The partnership
has been working continuously to provide operational and technical support to countries. Where
"possible, this has involved direct deployment of international support as well as help through virtual"
platforms.
"As of 3 August 2020, 588 offers of support from over 50 institutions and networks have been received"
"from GOARN partners; of these 86 experts have been deployed have been conducted, with 23 currently"
"deployed in the field and/ or providing virtual support, and an additional 10 deployments in process."
Heavy restrictions and quarantine requirements related to international air transport travel have had a
major impact on the deployment of international support.
GOARN is supporting evidence-based COVID-19 responses through the support of operational research.
"This includes leadership of the COVID-19 Research Roadmap Social Science Working Group, which"
includes a multi-disciplinary team of over 100 researchers currently working in six subgroups: home
"care, health systems and policy, good participatory practice, evidence to policy, healthcare worker"
infection prevention and control and Intensive care unit resource allocation. Partners are supporting the
"WHO Science Office to improve coordination and curation of COVID-19 evidence, primarily through the"
"Librarian Reserve Corps (LRC). On a daily basis, the LRC is supporting the alignment of publication"
"databases, performs real-time and urgent evidence searches, and conducts systematic reviews."
Focal points are embedded in seven technical or operational pillars to link GOARN research assets to
"support operational research needs at global, regional and country levels with ongoing support for 5"
technical guidance documents and 4 studies.
"The network supports the coordination of the Global RCCE Collaboration for COVID-19 involving WHO,"
"UNICEF and IFRC as lead agencies in the response, alongside wider community of RCCE response"
partners. GOARN hosts weekly global coordination for the RCCE COVID-19 response and has established
a virtual platform for the community. Since the start of the outbreak this has enabled the development
"of Global GOARN RCCE response strategy, multiple guidance and tools, active engagement of regional"
and country response partners in sharing experiences and knowledge on a timely manner and
"strengthened RCCE operational coordination. Currently, over 55 RCCE partners are collaborating on the"
COVID-19 response as a result of this support from all regions of the world. The GOARN steering
committee has supported the engagement of GOARN in the Global Collective Service model agreed by
"UNICEF, WHO and IFRC to be the framework through which to develop the RCCE collaboration further."
"The collective service will benefit from the full support of GOARN beyond coordination and networking,"
"to capacity building, training, operational research and response deployments. GOARN has also been"
instrumental in bringing the operational social science and RCCE areas of work together in response via
the close collaboration of GOARN leadership of the WHO R&D Blueprint social science working
group and the social sciences subgroup set up in the global collaboration. The goal is to ensure that all
response interventions involving communities and individual behaviours are fully informed by evidence
and integrated across the response pillars to ensure maximum effectiveness and impact of interventions
and remove redundancy and inefficiencies in the current approach.

Go.data is a core element of WHO and GOARN activities to support contact tracing capacity. Between
"January and July 2020, over 450 requests for information and support have been addressed. Worldwide,"
55 projects are implementing Go.Data as part of contact tracing and response. Virtual trainings and
"briefings, together with user support for epidemiology, analytics, interoperability and IT are regularly"
"provided to partners and countries. In addition, the recently launched Go.Data community of practice is"
becoming a main point of communication for users and a resource for the latest information and
documentation.
"The GOARN COVID-19 Knowledge Hub is curated by partners, including UN agencies, international and"
"national NGOs, academic institutions and consortiums. The Knowledge Hub is a public platform for"
access to the best resources available to support pandemic response. It was developed to ensure that
countries have access to the best information available given the deluge and fast paced production of
information during this pandemic. The Knowledge Hub offers multidisciplinary information on COVID-19
"for a variety of audiences from policy makers to responders, researchers, educators, affected"
communities and the general public.
The Global Health Cluster has contributed to the July update of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan
"(GHRP), advocating for the needs of affected people and implementing partners across the 28 country"
"and 2 regional Health Clusters. Among other activities, Country Health Clusters and partners are"
responding to the uptick in GBV in the COVID-19 context (Iraq Health Cluster) and protecting essential
health services (Yemen Health Cluster). The Global Health Cluster is continuing to co-lead the Global
"Information Management, Assessment & Analysis Cell on COVID-19 (GIMAC) and provides technical"
support for field requests.
The Global Health Cluster COVID-19 Task Team continues to work with partners to strengthen coordination
and effectiveness in the COVID-19 response. Four peer groups were established to develop tools and key
"messages on the following topics: gender-based violence and health, case management, prioritization of"
"essential health services and an ethical framework for humanitarian settings. To further inform their work,"
the Task Team will be conducting in-depth case studies in six countries to identify operational challenges and
"technical gaps. Task Team partner, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, will be conducting interviews in Arabic,"
"Bengali, English and French with between 10 and 12 key informants per country in Bangladesh (Cox's Bazar),"
"Burkina Faso, Chad, Iraq, Nigeria (north-eastern region) and Yemen."
Global epidemiological overview of COVID-19: week ending 2 August
Global overview
"Through the week ending 2 August, 17.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, including more than 680 000"
"deaths have been reported to WHO. Over the past seven days, the pandemic has continued to"
accelerate with almost 1.8 million new cases and 40 thousand new deaths reported – a daily average of
256 294 cases and 5675 deaths per day. It took only 4 days for the number of cases to increase from 16
million to 17 million.
"The WHO Region of the Americas remains the hardest-hit, contributing over half (54%) of all newly"
confirmed cases reported and deaths during the past week (Table 1). The Southeast Asian and Western
Pacific regions also continued to see substantial increases in confirmed cases and deaths. Among all the
"countries, territories, and areas reporting confirmed cases, the United States of America, Brazil, and"
India remain the top three most affected countries in the past seven days.

"As countries have eased public health and social measures, implemented to limit transmission of the",,,,
"virus, a number of these countries have observed clusters or resurgences of cases. Risks and",,,,
"vulnerabilities are further magnified in fragile, low-resource and conflict-affected settings.",,,,
Situation by WHO Region,,,,
"As of 2 August, in the Region of the Americas/PAHO, over 9.4 million cases and 350 000 deaths have",,,,
"been reported as of 2 August, including 1 million new cases in the past week. The United States and",,,,
"Brazil remained the most affected countries, collectively accounting for 75% of cumulative cases and",,,,
59% of deaths in the region in the past seven days – or 41% of cases and 36% of deaths globally to date.,,,,
"Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina also reported substantial increases.",,,,
"In Southeast Asian Region, the number of confirmed cases has increased by 17% while deaths have",,,,
"decreased by 3%, in the past 7 days. India and Bangladesh continue to report the majority of cases,",,,,
collectively accounting for 96% of all regional confirmed cases as of 2 August and 96% of cases in the,,,,
"past 7 days. Monsoon rains and flooding are affecting surveillance, testing and control efforts within",,,,
these countries.,,,,
"The European Region, continues to show relatively smaller fluctuations in reported cases and deaths.",,,,
"Russia, Spain, and Kazakhstan reported the majority of newly reported cases over the past week.",,,,
Increases in many countries have been partly attributed to large gatherings and the lack of observance,,,,
of social distancing measures.,,,,
"In the African Region, the number of incident confirmed cases and death decreased in the past 7 days.",,,,
This is primarily due to early declines observed in South Africa. South Africa has contributed almost two,,,,
"third of the regions cases and deaths to date, reporting over 69 000 new cases and almost 1500 new",,,,
"deaths in past week. In addition, substantial increases were recorded in Algeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, and",,,,
Ghana in the past seven days. There have been multiple reports across the region of hospital systems,,,,
"being overwhelmed and under resourced medical staff, as the number of confirmed cases and",,,,
individuals requiring hospitalization continues to grow.,,,,
"The Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a gradual decline in incidence since the end of June,",,,,
continuing over the past week with a 12% and 11% decrease in cases and deaths observed compared to,,,,
"the previous week. However, this trend masks rising case incidence in Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, and",,,,
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which demonstrates a heterogenous situation in the region.,,,,

"In the Western Pacific Region, after a prolonged period of relative stability, the number of incident"
"confirmed cases and deaths started to rise in the past month, with a 37% and 58% increase in the past"
"week, respectively. Philippines, Japan and Australia account for the majority of newly reported cases. In"
"Japan, while the initial rise in infections was centered in Tokyo, the more recent increase is due to a"
"higher number of confirmed cases in other urban areas, including more among older individuals. Papua"
"New Guinea and Philippines have also experienced a sharp rise in case incidence, while Vietnam"
reported their first locally-acquired cases since April.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",
delays to reflecting these data at global level.,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo shouldbe understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
*A smallnumber of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases;,
efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other: includes cases reported from,
international conveyances.,
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",
covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data.,
Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.",
