Situation Report – 197,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 4 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
"With over 18 million cases reported today, and new cases rising by around 250 000 each day, now is not the",,
"time to be complacent. As some economies and societies open up, WHO continues to urge the public to",,
remain vigilant and take precautions to avoid getting COVID-19; while urging countries to increase testing and,,
contact tracing to ensure no cases are missed and ensure appropriate treatment is available.,,
"In his regular media briefing yesterday, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros reiterated that “We have seen",,
"around the world, that it’s never too late to turn this pandemic around. If we act together today, we can save",,
"lives, we can save livelihoods if we do it all together.”",,
WHO has published a scientific brief on estimating mortality from COVID-19. The brief discusses the limitations,,
"and difficulties in interpreting the case fatality ratio of COVID-19, and potential biases that could arise in",,
ascertaining mortality.,,
Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ summarises the work being done by the WHO Regional Office for Africa and partners,,
to respond to the COVID-19 Infodemic.,,

Subject in Focus: WHO Regional Office for Africa leads regional collaboration to,
manage the COVID-19 infodemic,
"In February 2020, WHO raised the concern of an “infodemic”, that is, an overabundance of information,",
"some accurate, some false or misleading, that occurs during a public health crisis. An infodemic can",
"ultimately undermine trust in the public health response, which can in turn lead to the prolongation of a",
crisis and to people making risky decisions.,
Given the overwhelming volume of misinformation and the ease of rapid cross-border viral spread of,
"this misinformation, an effective approach to infodemic management requires a multi-stakeholder",
"collaboration at both the global and regional levels. In Africa, WHO is leading an Alliance of partners",
"comprised of operational agencies responding to the pandemic, fact-checking organizations, media",
outlets and technology companies to work collaboratively to respond to the COVID-19 Infodemic.,
The Alliance stakeholders are working together to:,
1.,"Quickly identify infodemic risks and public information gaps in Africa, through a comprehensive"
,"multi-stakeholder social listening process that encompasses social networks, mainstream media,"
,public radio and private messaging services such as WhatsApp.
2.,"Provide an operational hub for information sharing between African agencies, fact checkers and"
,"media, allowing for deep networking of expertise to facilitate rapid response to emergent"
,threats.
3.,Create highly engaging and shareable fact-based health information and fact checks that are
,"distributed and shared widely across the continent, including by media partners."
4.,Increase the resilience of African audiences to misinformation through the creation and
,distribution of misinformation literacy content that helps increase individual awareness of the
,risks associated with health misinformation and provides basic tools and steps to help avoid
,sharing falsehoods.
5.,"Support ongoing research into the efficacy of infodemic management interventions, including"
,the assessment of the impact of communications-based interventions on public behavior.
"At present, Alliance partners are working together to share findings from social monitoring (for example",
"what new claims are emerging and what old claims are re-emerging, where is this information",
"spreading, and what trends are observable) and to share expertise to support the work of fact checkers",
"(for example technical information about vaccine testing and provision, official positions on claims",
"related to WHO.) This type of collaboration is essential in infodemic response, because it allows for a",
holistic view of the regional information ecosystem and supports a highly coordinated response.,

CASE STUDY: Debunking the ‘COVID Organics’ claims
"Between April and May 2020, claims about the efficacy of ‘COVID Organics’ as a treatment"
"had risen, including claims that some countries supported the use of these products."
These claims and WHO’s approval (or lack thereof) of the approach circulated widely on
social networks and in mainstream media.
"To understand the spread of the ‘COVID Organics’ claims, Alliance partner UN Global Pulse"
"conducted widescale monitoring that showed that at its peak, the ‘COVID Organics’ story"
"was reaching almost 14 million people per day, and that mentions of the story were"
"focused in Nigeria, South Africa, Madagascar, Ghana and Senegal."
"Fact checkers, who were part of the Alliance, quickly published numerous investigations"
"into the story and debunked many of the associated claims, with supporting information"
from WHO and other agency sources.
"Moving forward, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) will be working through the Alliance with"
"experts in producing engaging journalistic content for social platforms, with the goal of producing fact"
checking content and misinformation literacy messages that are visually engaging and easily shareable.The Alliance will tap into features to help make the debunking of misinformation “viral” - to boost the
"reach of fact-based health information on the continent. To support this effort, and to ensure that"
"populations who do not have access to social media platforms are able to be reached, the Alliance will"
also work to distribute content and research through mainstream media outlets at a regional and
country levels.
The Africa Infodemic Response Alliance supports early detection and rapid response to infodemic risk.
"The present infodemic challenges will not end with the end of COVID-19, even if such an end were in"
"sight. Indeed, WHO AFRO anticipates that the upcoming wild poliovirus certification of eradication in the"
African Region and the introduction of the novel Oral Polio Vaccine (nOPV2) will spark new infodemic
challenges that may exacerbate fears and mistrust. The Africa Infodemic Response Alliance can play a
key long-term role in supporting effective infodemic management and response and provide a model
that can be replicated in other WHO regions in future.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness,,,,
"in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be",,,,
related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the,,,,
illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here,,,,
and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes",
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between,
"information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different",
"inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all",
"data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies,",
"reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others,",
"influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable",

efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.† Other: includes cases reported from,

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative numbers in the “new",
cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying when such adjustments,
occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to,
"previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see",

Additional table notes,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;

•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters in
,several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
