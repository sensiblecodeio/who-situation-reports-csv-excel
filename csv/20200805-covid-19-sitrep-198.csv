Situation Report – 198,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 5 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
"WHO Regional Director for the Americas, Dr Carissa Etienne, has warned of disruptions to",,
regular health services due to COVID-19. Health workers have been redirected to care for,,
"COVID-19 patients, people are hesitating to seek routine care due to fears of infection, and",,
global supply chains of medicines and equipment are strained.,,
"This week, the world celebrates Breastfeeding Awareness Week to highlight the importance of",,
breastfeeding. WHO recommendations on the initiation and continued breastfeeding of,,
infants and young children also apply to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As,,
"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros mentioned in yesterday’s press briefing, ‘the many, many",,
benefits of breastfeeding for newborn babies and children substantially outweigh the potential,,
risks for COVID-19 infection.’ The WHO Regional Office for Europe has released an article on,,
"Marko Obradovic, a paediatric nurse in Serbia, who describes the challenges and importance of",,
encouraging breastfeeding.,,
WHO has been supporting Suriname to address the COVID-19 pandemic and has assisted in,,
strengthening Suriname’s health system and through the Universal Health Coverage,,
"Partnership, with the goal of helping the country achieve universal health coverage.",,
Today we include two reports in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below. The first discusses a recently,,
"released WHO brief on estimating mortality from COVID-19, an extremely useful indicator of",,
the burden of disease that helps guide policy decisions. The second provides a summary of the,,
age and sex distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases from the WHO COVID-19 global,,
surveillance database from January to July 2020.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,18 354 342 cases (206 709),696 147 deaths (5 116)
Africa,834 147 cases (8 875),14 750 deaths (611)
Americas,9 841 842 cases (100 115),367 934 deaths (2 600)
Eastern Mediterranean,1 585 458 cases (10 907),41 601 deaths (399)
Europe,3 451 556 cases (21 623),214 731 deaths (476)
South-East Asia,2 299 433 cases (56 777),48 569 deaths (995)
Western Pacific,341 165 cases (8 412),8 549 deaths (35)

Subject in Focus: Estimating COVID-19 mortality rates
"An important characteristic of an infectious disease, particularly one caused by a novel"
"pathogen like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is its severity, including its"
ability to cause death.
"Fatality rates help us understand the severity of a disease, identify at-risk populations, and"
"evaluate the quality of healthcare. Furthermore, differences in mortality between groups"
of people and countries are important proxy indicators of relative risk of death that guide
policy decisions regarding scarce medical resource allocations.
"However, this is no easy task. To better understand fatality rates, WHO has published a"
scientific brief entitled ‘Estimating mortality from COVID-19’. This document is intended to
help countries estimate the proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases (the
"case fatality ratio, CFR) and, if possible, the proportion of deaths among all infected"
"individuals (the infection fatality ratio, IFR)."
"It looks in turn at how to calculate CFR and IFR, potential biases in the detection of cases"
"and deaths, approaches to minimizing these biases in estimating fatality rates during"
"ongoing epidemics, and how to take into account groups with different risk profiles, such"
as older people and those with underlying illness.
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, broad variations in CFR estimates have been published,"
which may be misleading. This scientific brief concludes by providing some explanations
"for these variations, and why making comparisons between countries can be problematic."
"WHO will continue to support countries to improve their population data on COVID-19,"
"and improve their estimates of fatality rates, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of their"
response by using such information to guide public health policy.
WHO global surveillance for human infection with coronavirus
"disease (COVID-19): Analysis of age and sex, data as of July 30 2020"
"Following the notification of the first COVID-19 cases in China in early January, WHO set up"
a global surveillance system to gather essential information to monitor the pandemic.
"Members States (MS) were requested to report daily count of confirmed cases and deaths,"
in addition to reporting a minimal set of information via a case based reporting system
using a case reporting form (CRF) or via the weekly aggregated surveillance system.
"As of 30 July, 133 countries, territories and areas have reported CRF data and 54 countries,"
territories and areas have reported weekly aggregate numbers.
A total of 16 298 556 confirmed cases had been reported globally. WHO received
information for 8 483 026 (52%) confirmed cases: 5 220 697 through CRF and 3 262 329
through weekly aggregate surveillance.

"Of 8 483 026 confirmed cases received via CRF and weekly aggregate surveillance,",
5 911 819 (70%) provided information on sex and 6 451 652 (76%) provided information on,
"age. Among the information received on sex, fifty-three percent (n=3 129 345) were male",
and 47 per cent (n=2 782 474) were female.,
The majority (64%) of cases were between the age of 25 to 64 years (Table 1).,
"From 24 February through 12 July 2020 (epidemiological weeks 9 to 28), the proportion of",
"cases aged 0-4 years, 5-24 years and 25-64 years have increased by seven-fold, six-fold and",
"three-fold, respectively (Figure 1). This trend may be explained by, but is not limited to, the",
following factors:,
•,early detection and testing were initially focused on identifying cases with severe
,"symptoms, which are more frequently observed among older people;"
•,Changes to case definitions and general awareness are now leading to detection of
,"more mild cases, many of whom tend to be younger;"
•,"expanded availability of testing with numerous drive-through testing, which likely"
,enables increased testing in communities;
•,toutbreak hotspots shifting over time to countries with lower age profiles (e.g.
,"developing countries, or countries with substantial ex-patriate dormitory populations);"
•,risky behavior after easing of public health and social measures implemented to
,"reduce the spread of the virus, which may have increased transmission among"
,younger population.

A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
