"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 6 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
The WHO Regional Office for the Americas has issued a warning against the use of chlorine,,
products as treatment for COVID-19. WHO recommends that people avoid consuming products,,
"containing chlorine dioxide or related substances (sodium hypochlorite, bleach, etc.) and that",,
all marketing of such products for therapeutic purposes be reported to the authorities.,,
The South African COVID-19 response is being bolstered by a surge team of health experts,,
"from WHO. The surge team will be jointly led by Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director",,
"for Africa and Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.",,
Forty-three experts from various fields will be deployed to support the COVID-19 outbreak,,
response management.,,
The WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia has urged countries in the region to maintain,,
"essential healthcare and accelerate the resumption of services that have been disrupted, by the",,
"pandemic, as an integral part of the COVID-19 response. Since the outbreak of COVID-19,",,
"repurposing of health workers, cancellation of elective care, closure of outpatient services,",,
"insufficient personal protective equipment, and changes in treatment policy have significantly",,
impacted the delivery of essential services.,,
Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ provides an overview of discussions on the Global Multidisciplinalry,,
Discussion on SARS-CoV-2 Modes of Transmission.,,

Subject in Focus: Global Multidisciplinary Platform Discussion on
SARS-CoV-2 Modes of Transmission
"On 3 August 2020, WHO hosted a Global Multidisciplinary Platform Discussion on SARS-"
CoV-2 Modes of Transmission on 3 August attended by more than 700 participants.
"Attendees included international experts in epidemiology, laboratory, infection prevention"
and control and clinical management international working groups of the WHO R&D
Blueprint for COVID-19 and researchers from other technical disciplines (see below). It
"also included national and international institutions including US CDC, ECDC and Global"
"Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GLOPID-R ), as well as WHO"
staff from all over the world. This discussion focused on the rapid progress of available
research on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
"Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was identified"
as a priority for research since the beginning of the pandemic and the February and July
2020 global R&D Blueprint meetings reiterated this priority. The meeting this week
brought together researchers to present the latest scientific evidence and identify
knowledge gaps and best methods to undertake the high-quality comprehensive research
"studies to better understand how, when and where transmission of the virus occurs. The"
"discussion included perspectives from experts in the fields of public health, infectious"
"respiratory diseases, virology, engineering and physical sciences, epidemiology,"
"phylogenetics, clinical management, social sciences, and infection prevention and control."
"Speakers discussed existing evidence on several modes of transmission - contact, droplet"
and airborne transmission - as well as on environmental contamination associated with
the fomite and fecal-oral routes of transmission. A panel of international experts focused
"on understanding how the virus is transmitted, when people are transmitting during the"
"course of their infection, and where the virus is transmitted more readily (that is what"
"settings, duration and intensity of exposure, and virologic, environmental, behavioural,"
"and sociological factors influence transmission), including characteristics of"
superspreading events. Possible “opportunistic” airborne transmission in community and
"healthcare settings was also discussed, with emphasis on the need for more research to"
better understand and prevent the conditions in which this may occur.
High-quality research is urgently needed to further improve our understanding of the
"transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, risk factors for infection, settings and conditions"
which can amplify transmission and to understand infectious dose.
WHO will summarize the discussions and conclusions in a future publication. It will also
work with experts to develop further standardized protocols outlining the best research
"methodologies, and seek funding opportunities with partners to support investigations in"
this important area.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
