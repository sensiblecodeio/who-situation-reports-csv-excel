"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 7 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
"As the continent nears one million cases, WHO is increasing COVID-19 support to hotspot",,
countries in Africa. Altogether more than 40 public health experts are expected to provide,,
"surge support, working with national and provincial counterparts on key areas of the response.",,
The Pan-American Health Organization/WHO Regional Office for the Americas/has drawn upon,,
the Strategic Fund for Public Health Supplies to procure and distribute millions of COVID-19,,
"diagnostic kits, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and other essential health supplies to",,

"to six countries. The Strategic Fund also helped finance PPE including face shields, gloves,",,
"goggles, gowns, masks and respirators for 26 countries in the region.",,
Environmental surveillance by testing of waste water for evidence of pathogens has a long,,
history of use in public health. WHO has published a scientific brief on how this form of,,
surveillance is being used in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.,,
Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is one of the most pressing challenges of our time.,,
WHO has published two new documents on the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility. One,,
outlines global procurement for COVID-19 vaccines and the other focuses on insuring,,
accelerated vaccine development and manufacturing.,,
Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ provides a summary of the 4th meeting of the IHR Emergency,,

"2020, and outlined key areas where further attention by the Emergency Committee was",
needed.,

"19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and",
"global response efforts. It encouraged all individuals, in particular young people,",

Parties should enable and support communities and individuals and thus build trust,

,fatigue
•,"Surveillance, testing and contact tracing"
•,Research on the virus and on the effectiveness of response measures
•,"Risk communication, community engagement and management of infodemics"
•,Vaccines and therapeutics
•,International travel

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
