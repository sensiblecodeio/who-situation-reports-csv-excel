Subject in Focus: The COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Progress,
Report,
"Last week WHO published the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Progress Report,",
taking stock of where we are in the outbreak and how the world has responded. By,
"working together with countries, partners, and communities, we have achieved a great",
"deal in these six months that have seen the world changed by COVID-19, and WHO change",
with it.,
The report highlights progress made up to 30 June 2020 under the three objectives,
outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Response and Preparedness Plan: scaling up,
international coordination and support; scaling up country preparedness and response by,
pillar; and accelerating research and innovation.,
Some of these achievements include the:,
•,"Solidarity Trial, helping find an effective treatment for COVID-19;"
•,"WHO Partners Platform, providing a tool that enables collaboration in response efforts;"
•,"COVID-19 Supply Chain System, sending tens of millions of pieces of equipment to"
,"many countries around the world, ensuring they reach those who need it most;"
•,COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund supporting WHO and partners in the global
,response;
•,"Global Research Roadmap, accelerating priority research and development;"
•,"Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, accelerating the development, production,"
,"and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines;"
•,Publishing of 130 guidance documents on various aspects of preparedness and
,response;
•,"Providing online and in-person training, technical missions and remote support."
"The report also highlights some of the key challenges faced so far, and provides an",
update on the resource requirements for the next phase of WHO’s response as part of,
the whole-of-UN approach to the pandemic.,
The report concludes by reminding us that COVID-19 is a truly global crisis: the only way to,
"overcome it is together, in global solidarity.",

Global epidemiological overview of COVID-19: week ending 9 August
Global overview
"Overall, there have been over 19.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, including more than"
"720 000 deaths, reported to WHO through the week ending 9 August. Over the past seven"
"days, over 1.8 million new cases of COVID-19 have been reported, a slight decrease of 2%,"
"compared to the previous week, while the number of deaths increased by 2% in the past"
seven days with over 41 000 new deaths reported during this time. This amounts to an
average of 254 502 cases and 5 858 deaths per day.
The biggest regional change in the number of new cases in the past seven days is
"represented by the marked decrease (23%) in the WHO Region of Africa, although deaths"
continued to rise (Table 1). While the WHO Region of the Americas still remains the
"hardest-hit, contributing over half of all newly confirmed cases reported (54%) and deaths"
"(63%) reported during the past week, the largest percentage increase in new cases and"
deaths was seen in the Western Pacific region (31% and 27% respectively). Among all the
"countries, territories, and areas reporting confirmed cases, the United States of America,"
"Brazil, and India remain the top three most affected countries in the past seven days."
"Across the globe, countries have implemented various control efforts, including mandated"
"mask wearing, local movement restrictions, and physical distancing measures to control"
the increases and clusters of new cases that followed the initial easing of public health and
social measures initially implemented earlier in the year.

,,,,,Week reported,,,,,

"In the Southeast Asian Region in the past seven days, the number of newly confirmed"
cases has increased by 9% while new deaths increased by 11%. India and Bangladesh
"continue to report the majority of cases, collectively accounting for 91% of all regional"
confirmed cases as of 9 August and 93% of cases in the past seven days. Monsoon rains
"and flooding across the region are affecting surveillance, testing, and control efforts"
"within these countries, and delays and gaps in case detection and reporting are"
anticipated.
"The European Region, continues to show relatively smaller fluctuations in reported cases"
"and deaths. Russia, Spain, and Kazakhstan reported the majority of newly reported cases"
over the past week. Increases in many countries across the region have been partly
attributed to large gatherings and the lapses in observance of social distancing measures.
"In the African Region, the number of newly confirmed cases decreased more than any"
"other region, although deaths in the region still increased in the past seven days. This is"
primarily due to early declines in newly reported case numbers observed in South Africa.
South Africa has contributed almost two thirds of the region’s cases and deaths to date
and reported over 49 000 new cases and 2 000 new deaths in the past week. Substantial
"increases were recorded in Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Algeria in the past seven days."
There have been multiple reports across the region of hospital systems being
"overwhelmed and under resourced medical staff, as the number of confirmed cases and"
individuals requiring hospitalization continues to grow.
The Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a gradual decline in incidence since the
"end of June, and this continued over the past week, with 4% and 7% decreases in new"
"cases and deaths, respectively, compared to the previous week. Despite this downward"
"trend, cumulative case incidence has risen for some countries, particularly in the Islamic"
"Republic of Iran, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Pakistan."
"In the Western Pacific Region, the number of newly confirmed cases and deaths continues"
"to rise, with a 31% and 27% increase respectively in the past week. The Philippines, Japan,"
and Australia accounted for the majority of newly reported cases. Papua New Guinea also
"reported a substantial increase in the number of newly confirmed cases, while Vietnam"
"reported a spike in deaths, compared to the previous week. The recent surge of cases in"
"the Philippines has been attributed to transmission in the workplace, economic hubs and"
industries as a result of the workers’ supposed lack of training in public safety and
minimum health standards.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.
[1]All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations
"Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo"
"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
•,Update on 10 August for Belgium: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national
,authorities: case counts adjusted from 4 April to 9 August and death counts
,adjusted from 08 to 09 August
•,Update on 10 August for Taiwan: Case counts for 09 August adjusted
,retrospectively by national authorities: 477 instead of 479
•,Update on 10 August for Japan: Case counts for 09 August adjusted retrospectively
,"by national authorities: 46,782 instead of 46,783"
•,Update on 10 August for Israel: Case counts for 09 August adjusted retrospectively
,"by national authorities: 1,761 new cases and 7 new deaths added"
