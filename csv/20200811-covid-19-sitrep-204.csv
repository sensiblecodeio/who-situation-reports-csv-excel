Coronavirus disease,,
(COVID-19),,
Situation Report – 204,,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 11 August 2020",,
Highlights,,
Nearly 20 million cases of COVID-19 have now been recorded. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros,,
stressed that behind these statistics there is a great deal of pain and suffering. He emphasized,,
that ‘There are two essential elements to addressing the pandemic effectively. Leaders must,,
step up to take action and citizens need to embrace new measures...My message is crystal-,,
"clear: suppress, suppress, suppress the virus’.",,
Dr Tedros sent a message of solidarity to the people of Beirut in the aftermath of the massive,,
"explosion which killed over 150 people, injured more than 6000 and made over 300 000 people",,
"homeless. ‘To the people of Beirut, the health workers and emergency workers on the ground,",,
"our thoughts are with you and we will continue to support you’, he said. WHO has sent surgical",,
"and major trauma supplies and personal protective equipment worth US$1.7 million, as well as",,
"providing support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, address psychosocial needs and facilitate",,
the rapid restoration of damaged health facilities. WHO has issued an appeal for US$76 million,,
in support of this work.,,
"A large shipment of medical respirators, medical masks, goggles and gowns –worth €1.1 million",,
– was recently delivered to the Republic of Moldova. The shipment was funded by the European,,
Union and procured by WHO to help health care workers respond effectively and safely to the,,
COVID-19 pandemic.,,
"Young people have an important role to play in the COVID-19 pandemic, both in terms of",,
reducing transmission and in engaging in the response. Tomorrow we celebrate International,,
Youth Day. This is explored in the ‘Subject in Focus’ below.,,
Situation in numbers (by WHO Region),,
Total (new cases in last 24 hours),,
Globally,19 936 210 cases (216 033),732 499 deaths (4 268)
Africa,903 249 cases (7 553),16 985 deaths (272)

Western Pacific,378 972 cases (8 351),8 862 deaths (51)

Subject in Focus: Celebrating International Youth Day and the positive
contribution of young people in the COVID-19 response
"In addition to its human cost, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting economies, employment,"
"education and health systems. As a result, young people around the world are being"
"confronted by new challenges and uncertainty. In spite of this, stories of resilience, innovation"
and solidarity are emerging daily where young people have embraced the opportunity to
contribute to the COVID-19 response.
The burden of severe disease has been much higher on older people than on young people.
"However, young people may be exposed to certain situations and activities that are known to"
increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These scenarios have been referred to as the ‘three
"Cs’ - crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces. Examples"
include poorly ventilated gyms or indoor restaurants; nightclubs; or large gatherings where
physical distancing cannot be maintained. Situations where all three C’s are encountered
simultaneously are considered the highest risk for COVID-19 transmission. Young people are
also able to transmit the virus to vulnerable people – people older than 60 years and/or with
underlying medical conditions.
"It is the responsibility of each person, whether young or old, to understand the risks associated"
with certain situations and activities and to make personal decisions that protect their health
and prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes avoiding the ‘three Cs’. Young people in
many settings have been leaders in their communities and among their peer networks in
"promoting access to information, combatting misinformation and translating and"
disseminating public health information. Not only is this enabling young people to make
"decisions that save lives and protect health, but it is helping to counter a growing culture of"
"blame, stigma and discrimination. International organizations, national health authorities and"
other trusted networks for information-sharing have a collective responsibility to increase
access to the right information and promote understanding about risk and transmission.
"On 12 August, the world celebrates International Youth Day, and this year the theme is “Youth"
Engagement for Global Action”. WHO will be highlighting the myriad ways in which young
"people are engaging at the global, national and local levels and contributing towards the"
COVID-19 pandemic response. Many young people are working on the frontlines as healthcare
"providers and other essential workers; youth-led initiatives are striving towards collaboration,"
solidarity and inclusivity; and others are using the opportunities provided by an unprecedented
access to information and digital technologies to communicate and share information.
"Tomorrow, as part of the International Youth Day activities, WHO and UNESCO will host a"
"webinar with the participation of Dr Tedros and UNICEF’s Executive Director Henrietta Fore, in"
"honor of the young people around the world who have demonstrated their resilience, collective"
action and creativity in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
"ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of",
similar status.,
