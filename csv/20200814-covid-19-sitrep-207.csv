Today’s ‘Subject in Focus’ highlights updated guidance on home care for patients with,,
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the management of their contacts. The document,,
provides guidance on the issues to be considered when deciding whether or not to provide,,
care for COVID-19 patients at home and offers advice for health workers and caregivers,,

Subject in Focus: Home care for patients with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 and management of their contacts
"On 13 August 2020, WHO updated guidance for the provision of care for patients with"
COVID-19 in a home setting. This replaces the previous version of the guidance published
17 March 2020.
This guidance was updated to align with recent updates to WHO surveillance case
definitions for COVID-19 and WHO guidance on clinical management for COVID-19. It has
also been expanded to include implementation aspects as well as considerations to
"identify and support patients who could receive care at home, and the infection,"
prevention and control (IPC) requirements for suitable and safe home care of people
"infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."
As this virus continues to spread and health systems struggle to find capacity to provide
"care, some people with COVID-19 may be cared for at home. The needs of the patient, the"
"caregiver, the household and community must all be considered when the decision to"
provide care for someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 at home is made. WHO has provided
updated guidance to policy makers and health professionals to assess the ability to safely
provide care for COVID-19 patients in the home setting and to support it with adequate
"tools, equipment, resources and instructions."
"Ideally, all patients with COVID-19 should be cared for in a health facility, but there are"
specific situations where they may be cared for safely at home. The guidance outlines
several factors that should be evaluated by the health care provider when determining if a
patient with COVID-19 can be cared for at home. These include the patient’s clinical
"condition and presence of underlying medical conditions, which put them at a higher risk"
"for developing severe disease, an evaluation of the home setting to ensure IPC and other"
"requirements can be met (such as basic hygiene and adequate ventilation), the ability of"
"the caregiver to provide care and recognize when the patient may be deteriorating,"
"adequate support for the caregiver (e.g., food, supplies, psychological support) and"
support of a trained health worker in the community. If specific requirements cannot be
"met, then alternative arrangements should be discussed with the patient and caregiver,"
such as isolation in an alternate or repurposed facility where available.
"Within the updated guidance, WHO provides specific advice for health workers and"
"caregivers providing or supporting care in a patient’s home, including IPC measures to be"
taken to protect the health worker or caregiver and prevent transmission of the COVID-19
virus.
"In addition, a new annex on the implementation of home care policies and guidelines,"
"which was developed with input from social sciences experts, provides some practical"
"examples of approaches towards ensuring patients, family, community and health"
"workers have the necessary supports, resources and communication to safely provide care"
in the home setting.

The full technical guidance is available here.

Definition of COVID-19 death,,,,
A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically,,,,
"compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear",,,,
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There,,,,
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.,,,,
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is,,,,
available here and here.,,,,

"Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes"
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected
"between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and"
other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and"
"change. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ"
"between countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts"
"presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays"
to reflecting these data at global level.
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the"
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of
"any country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its"
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border
"lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are"
arranged under the administering WHO region.
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply
that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar
"nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary"
products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

"(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes."
*A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-
confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in the data table.†Other:
includes cases reported from international conveyances.
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove
"large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as"
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become
"available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will"
be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the
most up-to-date data.
Additional table notes
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting.
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information

becomes available. Differing degrees of transmission may be present within,
countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the highest category reported within,
a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by"
,common exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined
,"through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not"
,linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance;
,and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
