Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
Weekly Epidemiological Update 1,
"Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10am CEST 16 August 2020",
"For the latest data and information on COVID-19, please see:",
•,WHO COVID-19 Dashboard
•,Rolling updates on COVID-19
•,WHO COVID-19 Weekly Operational Update
Global epidemiological situation,
"For the week ending 16 August, over 1.8 million new COVID-19 cases and 39 000 new deaths were",
reported to WHO.This brings the cumulative total to 21.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases including,
"761 000 deaths (Figure 1). In the past seven days, the number of reported daily cases rapidly increased
with an average of 260 000 cases and 5 500 deaths.",
"Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO region, 30 December to 16 August 2020**",
**See data table and figure notes.,
"The WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected region in the past seven days, accounting",
for 53% of all newly confirmed cases and 75% of reported deaths. The South-East Asia Region continues,
to report an increase in cases and is currently the second most affected region. While the number of,

"cases decreased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from the end of June through to 10 August, a 10%"
increase was reported in the number of cases reported in last seven days. The number of reported
"deaths, however, have continued to decrease across the region. The Western Pacific Region reported a"
"large increase in the number of deaths compared to the previous seven days, although, this accounted"
for just 1% of the new deaths reported globally. The African Region reported a decrease in the number
"of cases and deaths over the past seven days (Table 1, Figure 2)."
"Due to the resurgence of cases in many countries, stay at home measures and travel restrictions are"
being re-implemented as part of efforts to limit the transmission of the virus.
Situation by WHO Region
Region of the Americas
"In the WHO Region of the Americas, the number of cases reported last week remained stable compared"
"to the previous week, with a less than 1% increase in the number of newly confirmed cases. However,"
"during the same period, the number of deaths increased by 13%. The United States of America reported"
"360 000 new cases, a 4% decrease from the previous week. This decrease may in part be attributable to"
an underreporting of cases in California due to technology issues with the electronic laboratory
reporting system which reports into the state’s disease registry system.
The number of deaths reported in Peru increased by 220% in the past seven days to a total of 25 800
"and a cumulative death rate of 784 deaths per 1 million population, which is currently the highest in the"
region.
"Reports of COVID-19 cases among indigenous people are increasing across the region, with a reported"
mortality rate higher in this group compared to non-indigenous peoples.
South-East Asia Region
South-East Asia is the second most affected region and currently accounts for a respective 26% and 19%
of newly reported cases and deaths globally in the past seven days. The region has seen a steady
"increase in reported cases and deaths, with a 9% increase in the past 7 days, compared to the previous"
"week. India continues to report the majority of cases, accounting for 85% of all confirmed cases in the"
region as of 16 August and 92% of cases in the past seven days. The Maldives has recorded the highest
incidence rate globally as cases continue to increase in the country.
European Region
"The number of cases reported in the European Region has gradually increased in recent weeks, however,"
there was no substantial change in the number of cases reported this week compared to the previous
"week. Nevertheless, a number of countries in the region are showing a resurgence in cases including"
"France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Several COVID-19 clusters, which have"

"contributed to the resurgence of cases, have been reported in meat processing and packaging facilities"
"in a number of countries including Belgium, Denmark and Germany. A total of 2 480 deaths were"
"reported across the region in the past seven days, which is a 21% decrease from the previous week."
"However, following a retrospective review process in the United Kingdom, over 5 000 deaths were"
"deducted from the country’s total COVID-19 deaths, resulting in a decrease of 2 728 deaths in the"
European region.
African Region
The African Region reported the largest decrease in the number of newly reported cases (27%) and
"deaths (21%) in the past seven days, primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in South Africa,"
"Kenya, Algeria, Nigeria and Ghana."
"Conversely, Ethiopia reported a 56% and 12% increase in the number of cases and deaths respectively,"
"with more than half of the cases reported in Addis Ababa. Due to the increase in cases, a month-long"
testing and prevention campaign will be implemented with a plan to carry out 400 000 tests.
"There are increasing reports of healthcare worker infections across the region, resulting in an"
"overburdened health care system in several countries including Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe."
Eastern Mediterranean Region
"Following five weeks of decline in the number of cases reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, a"
"total of 88 700 new cases were reported in the last seven days, a 10% increase in the number of newly"
reported cases compared to the previous week. While countries in the Gulf state are reporting a decline
"in incidence, Iraq, Morocco, occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon and Libya are reporting an increase"
in cases. The number of cases and deaths reported in Pakistan in the past seven days decreased by 20%
"and 24% respectively from the previous week, resulting in the lifting of lockdown restrictions across the"
country.
Western Pacific Region
The number of cases reported in the Western Pacific Region decreased by 5% as the number of new
"cases reported in Japan, Australia, Singapore and Viet Nam decreased in the past seven days. However,"
"the number of deaths reported increased by 90% mainly due to increases reported in the Philippines,"
"Japan, Viet Nam, China and Australia. The Republic of Korea continues to report cases associated with"
religious clusters and reported an increase of 210% in the number of cases compared to last week. On
"August 11, New Zealand reported a new locally acquired case, after recording 102 days with no"
community transmission. A total of 52 new cases have been reported in the past seven days resulting in
a temporary lockdown of the northern part of the country. New Zealand is the third country in the
region to report a resurgence in cases after a period of little or no known community transmission.
Other countries include Australia and Viet Nam.

Key weekly updates,
•,“There are two essential elements to addressing the pandemic effectively: leaders must step up to take
,"action and citizens need to embrace new measures...My message is crystal clear: suppress, suppress,"
,suppress the virus.”
,"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, at his regular media briefing on Monday, 10 August"
•,"The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is a global collaboration to accelerate the development,"
,"production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Nine vaccine candidates"
,are currently in the portfolio of the vaccines pillar (called COVAX) and going through phase two or phase
,"three trials. This portfolio, already the broadest in the world, is constantly expanding. The ACT-"
,Accelerator is the only up-and-running global initiative that brings together all the global research and
,"development, manufacturing, regulatory, purchasing and procurement needed for all the tools required"
,to end the pandemic.
•,Access to basic handwashing facilities is a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the
,midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring
,Programme (JMP) found that 43% of schools worldwide lacked access to basic handwashing with soap
,and water in 2019. UNICEF and partners have published a Framework for Reopening schools and
,"guidance on hand hygiene, which compliments Key Messages and Actions for COVID-19 Prevention and"
,Control in Schools and Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-
,19.
•,WHO has published updated guidance on home care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
,and the management of their contacts. The document provides guidance on the issues to be considered
,when deciding whether or not to provide care for COVID-19 patients at home and offers advice for
,health workers and caregivers providing that care.
•,"WHO has published the Emergency Global Supply Chain System (COVID-19) catalogue, which lists all"

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented is based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO surveillance definitions and guidance. While steps are",,,
"taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion critiera, testing strategies, reporting practice, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/ areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",,,
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,,,

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
