"With the exception of the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, a decrease in the weekly"
"case incidence was reported across WHO regions in the last seven days (Table 1, Figure 2). Although the"
"WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected, accounting for 50% of newly reported cases"
"and 62% of deaths, the region had the largest decrease compared to the previous week. The South-East"
"Asia Region, which is the second most active region, continues to report an increase accounting for 28%"
"and 15% of newly reported cases and deaths respectively. In the European Region, the number of cases"
"reported has consistently increased over the last three weeks, however, only a slight decrease (1%) was"
"reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths have continued to decrease across the"
"region. In the Eastern Mediterrenean Region, the number of reported cases increased by 4% compared"
"to the previous week, however, the number of reported deaths have consistently decreased over the"
"last six weeks. Likewise, the African and Western Pacific regions reported overall decreases in case"

Key weekly updates,
•,"During the 20 August Member State Briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted that “the"
,fastest way to end the pandemic and reopen economies is to start by protecting the highest risk
,"populations everywhere, rather than the entire populations of just some countries.” He encouraged"
,"all countries to join the COVAX Global Vaccines Facility, part of the ACT Accelerator – a critical"
,mechanism for joint procurement and pooling risk across multiple vaccines. Nine vaccine candidates
,in the COVAX portfolio are currently going through Phase II or Phase III clinical trials. WHO is
,"proposing to allocate vaccines in two phases. Speaking on 24 August, Dr Tedros further explained"
,that “the Facility is the critical mechanism for joint procurement and pooling risk across multiple
,vaccines so that whatever vaccine is proven to be safe and effective – all countries within the Facility
,"will be able to access them. Most importantly, it is the mechanism to enable a globally coordinated"
,"rollout. This is in the interests of all countries, even those that have invested with individual"
,manufacturers independently.” WHO issued terms of agreement for all countries to confirm how
,"they prefer to join the mechanism, with a deadline of 31 August."
•,WHO has published updated guidance on quarantine measures for individuals who are identified as
,"contacts of a case of COVID-19. This includes information on the implementation of quarantine, as"
,well as on ventilation and on the care of children in quarantine.
•,WHO has published new guidance on the use of masks for children which serves as an annex to
,previously published guidance on use of masks in the context of COVID-19. The Q&A on children and
,the use of masks has recently been updated that provides answers to questions the public may have.
•,"Speaking at a press conference held jointly with UNICEF, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional"
,Director for Africa said “Schools have paved the way to success for many Africans. They also provide
,a safe haven for many children in challenging circumstances to develop and thrive. We must not be
,blind-sided by our efforts to contain COVID-19 and end up with a lost generation. Just as countries
,"are opening businesses safely, we can reopen schools. This decision must be guided by a thorough"
,"risk analysis to ensure the safety of children, teachers and parents and with key measures like"
,"physical distancing put in place.” In a WHO survey of 39 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, only six"
,schools were found to be fully open. The impact of extended disruption to education as a result of
,"school closure is significant, and inlcudes poor nutrition, stress, increased exposure to violence and"
,"exploitation, childhood pregnancies, and diminished educational progress. WHO and UNICEF have"
,urged governments in Africa to promote the safe reopening of schools while taking measures to limit
,the spread of the virus.
•,"Globally, risks of COVID-19 resurgence remain in all countries that have managed to suppress"
,"transmission. Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, highlighted this during a"
,"statement to the press, indicating that as summer turns to autumn in the northern hemisphere, we"
,"must make sure that we adopt the right public health measures to enable the safe return to school,"

"manage the approaching influenza season, sustain our economies, and address the increased health",
risks to older people at this time of year.,
•,The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health and raised concerns of an increase in
,domestic violence in the Region of the Americas. WHO Regional-Director Carissa F. Etienne has
,counseled that countries in the Americas should expand and invest in mental health services. WHO
,"has produced several publications on mental health and COVID-19, including advice for the public, a"
,"children’s book, and other guidance."
•,Recent studies that show an increased risk among pregnant women of presenting with severe forms
,"of COVID-19. In light of this, the WHO Regional Office for the Americas is encouraging countries to"
,step up efforts to ensure access to prenatal care services for pregnant women.
•,
,WHO and the Jack Ma Foundation have donated COVID-19 essential medical supplies to 20
,"Caribbean countries. The supplies, which landed in Barbados, will be delivered through a new"
,"integrated regional logistics hub, supported by a donation by the Government of Canada."
•,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected older people disproportionately, especially those living in long-"
,term care facilities. Some countries indicate that more than 40% of COVID-19 related deaths have
,been linked to long-term care facilities. The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has
,produced a communication toolkit for long-term care facilities to support Infection Prevention and
,Control. This compliments a WHO policy brief released last month on preventing and managing
,COVID-19 across long-term care services.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented is based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion critiera, testing strategies, reporting practice, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/ areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",,,
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,,,

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
