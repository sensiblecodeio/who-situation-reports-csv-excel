Situation by WHO Region,,,
African Region,,,
Several countries in the Region that were previous COVID-19 hotspots have recorded a reduction in case,,,
"incidence including Ghana, Kenya, Gabon and Madagascar. While the observed declining trends are",,,
"encouraging, the figures should be interpreted cautiously as they may be affected by many factors,",,,
"including the current testing capacity and strategy, and delays in reporting.",,,
"Cases in Ethiopia have continued to rise, reaching new highs this week (10 621 cases) with Addis Ababa",,,
"remaining the worst affected region. In response, the Ethiopian government, with support from WHO,",,,
have launched the COVID-19 Enhanced Community Based Activities and Testing Campaign (ComBAT).,,,
"ComBAT aims to reach out to over 60 million individuals in a variety of settings, conduct 200 000 tests",,,
and treat 10 000 cases.,,,
"At 622 551 cases, South Africa has the fifth highest number of COVID-19 infections globally and the",,,
"highest number in Africa. However, there has been a marked decline in new cases since they peaked on",,,
"25 July at 13 944 cases, and the downward trend has continued this week with new cases falling by 34%",,,
"(Figure 3). As a result, the government has eased public health and social measures while reminding the",,,
public to remain vigilant.,,,

Region of the Americas,,
"The Americas account for approximately 13% of the world’s population, but over 50% of officially",,
"reported global cases and deaths. Currently, while the biggest drivers of the case counts in the region",,
"have observed a moderate decline or stabalisation of case incidence (Figure 4), increasing trends are",,
"now being seen in other parts of the region including Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Social",,
gatherings could also have contributed to the increase in cases in the region. WHO recommends avoiding,,
"the ‘three c’s’-crowded places, close contact settings, and confined and enclosed settings. More advice from",,
WHO on how to protect yourself and others from the spread COVID-19 can be found here.,,
"The United States of America has the highest number of cases in the world – over 5.8 million cases, a",,
"quarter of the global total. However, the country has witnessed a decline in new cases from previous",,
peaks in July of over 70 000 cases per day to an average of 41 000 new cases per day this past week. As,,
"school and university campuses have reopened, there have been news reports of students testing",,
positive. WHO has published guidance for school-related public health measures in the context of,,
COVID-19.,,
"Although cases in Colombia have declined in the past week, they have been gradually increasing since",,
June and continued caution is required. After five months of implementing public health and social,,
"measures, Colombia will begin easing the measures beginning 1 September.",,
Argentina has reported new peaks in the number of cases cases reported weekly and an upward,,
trajectory in cases and deaths since June. Cases in Mexico declined by 6% in the past week and have,,
declined gradually across the month of August. Mexico is implementing remote teaching and education,,
for children to reduce transmission.,,

Eastern Mediterranean Region,,,
The Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a fluctuating incidence of new cases in recent weeks,,,
"(Figure 5). The highest number of new cases have been seen in Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and",,,
"Kuwait. WHO, in partnership with the Iraqi Ministry of Health and its implementing partners, has",,,
concluded another round of a COVID-19 awareness-raising campaign that intensified community outreach,,,
efforts to educate people on measures to limit transmission of COVID-19. The campaign reached more,,,
"than 5 million people in four densely populated and heavily affected areas in Basra, Wasit, Thi Qar and",,,
"Missan. Campaign teams are moving to the Kurdistan region and will be targeting 9 heavily populated,",,,
high-risk areas in Sulaymaniyah province. Over the past week WHO has also delivered 6 ambulances to,,,
the Ministry of Health of the Kurdistan region and 22 tonnes of COVID-19 equipment.,,,
"In Pakistan, cases have fallen from over 5 000 per day in mid-June to 2 871 cases in the past week. As the",,,
"public health and social measures are lifted, the public is encouraged to take precautions to ensure a",,,
"resurgence does not occur particularly as they celebrate the first 10 days of the month of Muharram,",,,

and Ukraine reporting the highest number of new cases this week. Spain has seen a resurgence since,,
mid-July and cases are now reaching the peaks previously seen in March and April. July and August is the,,
"holiday season in Spain, and social interactions have likely contributed to the increased number of",,
reported cases. Spain has deployed the military to support contact tracing activities.,,
France has also seen a growing number of cases since the end of July with cases rising from around 500,,
cases per day to approximately 4 773 cases per day over the past week.,,
"Cases in Italy have shown a marked increase in the past seven days, up by 85% overall compared to last",,

"South-East Asia has reported the largest week-on-week increase (Figure 7), largely due to increased case",,,
"detections in India. India has reported nearly 500 000 new cases in the past seven days, a 9% increase",,,
compared to the previous seven days and the highest numbers of new cases globally. While these trends,,,
"are concerning, the increase in cases should be seen against a substansive rise in testing in recent weeks.",,,
"In Indonesia, cases have been gradually increasing while there are also concerns about transmission",,,
among family members of school children as 40% of people aged 60 years and older in Indonesia live in,,,
"three-generation households, meaning that they live with their children and grandchildren. WHO has",,,
published interim guidance on considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of,,,
COVID-19 and a joint document with UNICEF and IFRC on key messages and actions for COVID-19,,,

Key weekly updates,
•,WHO has issued updated interim guidance on hotels and other accommodation facilities to help the
,sector protect the safety of staff and clients. See also the Q&A’s on Staying at hotels and accommodation
,establishments and COVID-19 and Working in hotels and COVID-19.
•,"WHO has also released guidance for shipowners, seafarers, unions and associations and associated
authorities for promoting public health measures on cargo ships and fishing vessels. This complements"
,guidance for employers to make sure they implement containment measures at workplaces and the
,related Q&A.
•,"Speaking at his regular media briefing on 27 August, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted the"
,momentous achievement of eradicating wild poliovirus in Africa and sleeping sickness in Togo. Dr Tedros
,"went on to say that “globally, we need the same spirit of solidarity and partnership that are helping to"
,end polio and sleeping sickness to end the COVID-19 pandemic.”
•,The results of a WHO survey conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on up to 25
,"essential health services in countries show disruptions of essential health services in nearly all countries,"
•,"and more so in lower-income than higher-income countries. The great majority of service disruptions
were partial, which was defined as a change of 5–50% in service provision or use.
WHO has published an overview of the structure, methodology, and assumptions used by the COVID-19
Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (ESFT). The ESFT is designed to help governments, partners, and other"
,stakeholders to estimate potential requirements for essential supplies to respond to the current
,pandemic of COVID-19. See also the ESFT Frequently Asked Questions.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented is based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion critiera, testing strategies, reporting practice, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/ areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",,,
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,,,

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
