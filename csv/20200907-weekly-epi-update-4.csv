Key weekly updates,,
•,"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing on Friday, spelled out four essential",
,"things that all countries, communities and individuals must focus on to rein in COVID-19:",
,o,Prevent amplifying events. COVID-19 spreads very efficiently among clusters of people;
,o,"Reduce deaths by protecting vulnerable groups, including older people, those with underlying"
,,conditions and essential workers;
,o,Empower people: individuals must play their part by taking the measures we know work to
,,"protect themselves and others – stay at least one metre away from others, clean hands"
,,"regularly, practise respiratory etiquette, and wear a mask as recommended; and"
,o,"Governments must take tailored actions to find, isolate, test and care for cases, and trace and"
,,quarantine contacts.
•,WHO has published guidance on the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with COVID-,
,"19. Based on current evidence, two recommendations are made: a strong recommendation for",
,"systemic corticosteroid therapy for 7 to 10 days in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, and a",
,conditional recommendation not to use corticosteroid therapy in patients with nonsevere COVID-19.,
•,WHO has also published guidance for individuals who tend to the bodies of persons who have died of,
,suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The document updates guidance issued on 24 March with the,
,following new or modified content: clarification of body bag requirements; clarification of personal,
,protective equipment (PPE) requirements during autopsies; updated ventilation requirements during,
,autopsy.,
•,"At the first meeting of the Technical Advisory Group on Behavioural Insights and Sciences for Health,",
,Dr Tedros said “The COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world that public health agencies and experts,
,need a better understanding of how people and societies behave and make decisions in relation to,
,"their health"". The group brings together some 21 advisors representing a variety of countries and",
,expertise in related disciplines.,
•,"Many parents, educators and children themselves have concerns and anxieties about going to school",
,"during these times. WHO/Europe and the Ministry of Health, Italy, have released a joint statement on",
,"schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic, discussing some of the measures that can be considered",
,"for risk reduction in school settings. These include: protective measures, such as masks, hand",
,"hygiene, and social distancing; specific policies for at-risk children; and online learning.",
•,"While the race to find safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines continues, African countries are signing",
,"up to a ground-breaking initiative, which aims to secure at least 220 million doses of vaccine for the",
,"continent, once licensed and approved. All 54 countries on the continent have expressed interest in",
,"COVAX, a global initiative which is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations",
,"(CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The European",
,"Commission has joined the COVAX Facility, and Dr Tedros thanked the Commission for its",
,contribution of 400 million euros.,
•,WHO has launched an appeal for at least US$76 million to support Lebanon in the wake of the blasts,
,"four weeks ago, which left more than 6,500 people injured, 300,000 people homeless, and severely",
,damaged critical health infrastructure and medical supplies. Any individual or organization can,
,contribute through the WHO Foundation.,

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented is based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion critiera, testing strategies, reporting practice, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/ areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",,,
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,,,

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
