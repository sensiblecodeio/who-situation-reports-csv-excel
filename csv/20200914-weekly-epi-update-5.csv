"In the week from 7 through 13 September, there were over 1.8 million new cases of COVID-19,",,,
comparable to the previous seven days (Table 1); while deaths increased slightly as compared to the,,,
"previous week, with over 40 600 deaths reported.",,,
The Region of the Americas has consistently registered the greatest number of reported cases for many,,,
weeks. It continues to account for nearly half of the global total of cases even as cases have declined in,,,
the reporting week. The African Region also showed a decline in reported cases this week and was the,,,
only region to report a decline in deaths.,,,

Situation by WHO Region,,,
African Region,,,
The African Region has witnessed declining trends in the number of new cases reported (a 14% decrease,,,
"in cases and a 15% decrease in deaths in the past seven days), with 26 of the 47 affected countries",,,
"reporting decreases in the past week. While this is encouraging, vigilance is still essential as many factors",,,
"may be influencing these trends such as testing capacity and strategy, along with delays in reporting in",,,
some areas.,,,
While South Africa continues to account for the greatest number of cumulative reported cases in the,,,
"region (Table 2), disease incidence by 1 million population is highest in Mayotte (12 367 per million).",,,
Cumulative deaths per million population remains the highest in South Africa (260 per million,,,
population).,,,
"Elsewhere in the region, WHO has donated life-saving equipment and medical supplies and helped",,,
"established a new WHO-supported COVID-19 testing molecular laboratory in Makeni City,",,,
"northern Sierra Leone, to facilitate scaling up of testing capacity for the disease in the country. Sierra",,,
Leone has continued to report COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic amidst other ongoing,,,
"communicable diseases outbreaks. Sierre Leone reported 53 cases and 1 death this week, resulting in a",,,
cumulative total of 263 cases per million population and 9 deaths per million population.,,,

"stay safe and healthy during the pandemic for different ages, risk groups and settings.",,
"While the numbers are relatively low (Table 2) as compared to other countries in the region,",,
"Guadeloupe has reported its highest number of cases this week, rising from 428 new cases in the",,
"previous weekly update to 1717 new cases this week, and the transmission pattern has now moved from",,
clusters of cases to community transmission. Cumulative cases and deaths have increased relative to the,,
"territory’s population, over 100% in cases (3 406 to 7 698 per million population) and a 20% increase in",,
cumulative deaths (50 to 60 per million population) in the past seven days.,,
"In the past week, Curaçao has shown the highest weekly increase in the number of cases since the start",,
"of the outbreak in the country, a 250% increase in weekly new cases reported which translates to a 73%",,
increase in cumulative cases from 475 to 823 per million population.,,
While cases reported this week in Costa Rica are in line with the average for the country in the past few,,

"6% of global cases. Seasonal religious and cultural mass gatherings, wedding celebrations and other",,
social events have contributed to the upsurge of cases in different countries in the region. Upticks of,,
cases reported in Tunisia and Jordan have been linked to ceremonies and celebrations.,,
"Cases in Morocco have reached a peak at approximately 2 000 per day, an increase of 41% in weekly",,
"new cases, resulting in 2 288 cases per million population. The majority of new cases (42%) are being",,

cases per million population from 231 to 300. Deaths have remained stable at 2 per million population.,,
"Additionally, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in a refugee camp hosting Syrian refugees.",,
"In Libya, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has more than doubled over the past two",,
weeks; both the cumulative cases and deaths per million population in Libya has increased by 30% in the,,

Key weekly updates,,
•,The first meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Review Committee on the,
,functioning of the IHR during the COVID-19 pandemic was held this week. WHO Director-General Dr,
,Tedros stated that the committee would review the functioning of the IHR during the COVID-19,
,"response, including IHR provisions related to, but not limited to, the following six areas:",
,o,"The convening of the Emergency Committee and its working modalities, and in particular, the"
,,binary mechanism for declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern;
,o,"The international coordination and collaboration for response, including the role and functioning"
,,of national IHR focal points;
,o,"Outbreak alert, verification and risk assessment, information sharing and communication;"
,o,Additional health measures in relation to international travel;
,o,"Implementation and reporting of IHR core capacities, including the possibility of establishing peer"
,,review processes for capacity assessments;
,o,Examining progress made on the implementation of recommendations from previous IHR review
,,committees.
•,As public health and safety measures begin to reduce COVID-19 cases to manageable levels in some,
,"countries, the epidemiological practice of contact tracing must go into full force.This becomes",
,"complicated and time-consuming very quickly, especially in the context of COVID-19, as the virus can",
,be transmitted between people without even causing symptoms. While conventional contact tracing,
,"methods will always remain relevant, digital tools present an opportunity to optimize traditional",
•,"approaches. WHO is pursuing multiple avenues at once: behind the scenes bringing together privatesector, innovators and governments to scale up technology and digital inclusion; and on the ground,for example in humanitarian settings.
In his second regular media briefing of last week, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted that",
,"COVID-19 is like no other disease in history, in that it has seen such rapid development in research. InApril, together with the European Commission and severalother partners, WHO launched the Accessto COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, to catalyze the development of and equitable access tovaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. WHO co-hosted the first ACT Accelerator Facilitation Council",
,meeting last week. The Council reiterated that there is a need for a significant increase in funding in,
,order for the ACT Accelerator to be able to deliver on its goals.,
•,The ability to confirm COVID-19 disease relies on the accurate detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.,
,WHO has published interim guidance for countries who are considering the integration of rapid,
,immunoassays into COVID-19 outbreak management programs and has also revised guidance on,
,diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 which provides more background information on clinical diagnostic,
•,"algorithms and new findings from the literature and best practices.
Surveys by UNICEF and WHO reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to",
,"health services, which threaten to undo decades of hard-won progress, particularly in the number of",
,"global deaths in children under five years old, which was at its lowest point on record in 2019.",

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion critiera, testing strategies, reporting practice, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/ areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",,,
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,,,

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from internationalconveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
