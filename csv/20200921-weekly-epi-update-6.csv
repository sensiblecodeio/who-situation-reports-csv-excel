Key weekly updates,,,
,•,As the world comes together at an unprecedented mostly virtual 75th UN General Assembly from 15-,
,,"31 September, WHO has three messages to share:",
,,1.,Equitable access to COVID-19 tools. WHO calls on world leaders to support the Access to
,,,"COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator, a unique international collaboration to fast-track the"
,,,"development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines"
,,,"globally, while strengthening health systems."
,,2.,Maintain the momentum towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The
,,,pandemic risks unravelling decades of gains made in health and development. According to a
,,,"recent WHO survey, 90% of countries are experiencing disruptions to essential health"
,,,services.
,,3.,"We must prepare for the next pandemic together, now. A year ago the independent Global"
,,,"Preparedness Monitoring Board warned of the threat of a pandemic, calling for global leaders to"
,,,"take urgent, united action to prepare. Last week, the Board issued its 2020 report, ‘A World in"
,,,"Disorder’, which outlined five urgent actions to be taken: responsible leadership; engaged"
,,,citizenship; strong and agile systems for health security; sustained investment; and robust global
,,,governance of preparedness.
•,"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing on Friday, highlighted that this is a",,
,"critical moment for countries. As cases and deaths have started to spike again, he called upon",,
,leaders to put targeted measures in place which can help suppress the spread of the virus and,,
,ensure that health systems and workers are protected. Individuals must also practise physical,,
,"distancing, clean their hands frequently, wear a mask as advised, cough and sneeze safely away from",,
,"others, avoid crowds, and keep windows and doors open when they can’t meet friends and family",,
,outside.,,
•,WHO has published new guidance on school-related public health measures that examines,,
,"considerations for school operations, and the measures needed to minimize the risk to students and",,
,staff of COVID-19.,,
•,"On 17 September, we celebrated World Patient Safety Day to raise global awareness of the",,
,importance of health worker safety and its interlinkages with patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic,,
,has exerted unprecedented pressure on health systems worldwide. Health systems can only function,,
,"with health workers, and a knowledgeable, skilled and motivated health workforce is critical for the",,
,provision of safe care to patients.,,
•,WHO has released a slide set on ‘What we know about the long-term effects of COVID-19’. Typically,,
,"people recover from COVID-19 after two to six weeks; however, for some people, including young",,
,"adults and persons with no underlying medical conditions who were not hospitalized, symptoms may",,
,linger or recur for weeks or months following initial recovery. Some patients develop medical,,
,"complications that may have lasting health effects. Much is still unknown, and more time and",,
,research are needed to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19.,,

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
