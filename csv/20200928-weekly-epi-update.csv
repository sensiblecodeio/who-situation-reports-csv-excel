Key weekly updates,
•,"COVID-19: Nearly 33 million cases and one million deaths in 9 months. As Dr Mike Ryan, Executive"
,Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme said at the press conference on Friday 25
,"September, “the realities of getting a vaccine out there in the next nine months is a big task for"
,"everyone involved. There is a lot that can be done to save lives, both in terms of disease control,"
,existing life-saving measures and the innovations that are coming down the pipe. Are we willing to
,"make the investments now that are needed in the ACT Accelerator, especially in COVAX?”"
•,"A total of 67 higher income economies have joined the COVAX Facility, with another 34 expected to"
,"sign, joining 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible for support for the procurement of"
,"vaccines. However, so far only a tenth of the $35 billion needed for scale-up and impact have been"
,"received, a small investment considering that the global economy is expected to contract by trillions"
•,"of US dollars this year alone. WHO’s aim is to have two billion doses of vaccine available by the end of
2021.
A new report from Every Woman Every Child, “Protect the Progress: Rise, Refocus, Recover, 2020”"
,"warns that the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating existing inequities, with reported disruptions in
essential health interventions disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable women and
children. ""There is no doubt that the pandemic has set back global efforts to improve the health and"
,"well-being of women and children, but that should only serve to strengthen our resolve,"" said Dr"
•,"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
WHO has released a video series, Science in 5, in which experts explain the science about specific"
,"issues related to COVID-19. So far five episodes have been released on subjects including herd
immunity, SARS-CoV2, myths vs science, and reopening schools. Watch these short videos on WHO’s
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts or listen to the podcasts."
•,"On 23 September, WHO together with the UN, specialised agencies and partners called on countries
to develop and implement action plans to promote the timely dissemination of science-based"
,information and prevent the spread of false information while respecting freedom of expression.
•,"WHO has published the Emergency Global Supply Chain System (COVID-19) catalogue, which lists all"
,"medical devices, including personal protective equipment, medical equipment, medical consumables,"
,"single use devices, laboratory and test-related devices that may be requested through the COVID-19"

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from internationalconveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
