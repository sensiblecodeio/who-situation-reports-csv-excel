"Although globally the number of new cases was similar to the number of cases in the previous week,",,,,,,,
"there is considerable variation on a country- by-country basis. In several countries, the number of new",,,,,,,
"cases is rising again, and in many (most notably within the European Region) the second wave is",,,,,,,
exceeding previous peaks; this can be partly attributed to enhancements in surveillance capacities over,,,,,,,
"time. In other countries we have seen a gradual decline in new cases from earlier peaks in August, for",,,,,,,
"example in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. In India and the Philippines, the number of new cases appear to",,,,,,,
"have stabilized, but they are still reporting high numbers. There are also examples of countries that have",,,,,,,
"consistently shown an increasing incidence as their first wave continues; these include Indonesia, Iraq,",,,,,,,
"and Myanmar, although Indonesia is reporting a slight drop this week. South Africa and Australia are",,,,,,,
examples of countries that have successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases and have seen,,,,,,,
large reductions from earlier peaks.,,,,,,,

Situation by WHO Region,,,
African Region,,,
"South Africa and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in Africa, followed by",,,
"Mozambique, Uganda, and Nigeria. Africa has seen a continuous decline in case incidence since mid-July;",,,
"however, this trend is now slowing (Figure 3). For the first week since early August, the number of new",,,
deaths has risen – led by South Africa with a 29% increase in deaths in the past week.,,,
South Africa also has the second- highest mortality rate in the Region – 11 461 deaths per 1 million,,,
population. The provinces of Gauteng and the Western Cape have reported the most cases and deaths,,,
"to date; however, these regions, as well as the country itself, have maintained sustained declines in the",,,
"daily incidence since the end of July. Despite this, weekly case numbers have continued to rise in less",,,
populated provinces. The country moved to Alert Level 1 as of 21 September (the least strigent of the,,,
"five alert levels applied by the South African Goverment), with all sectors of the economy now open with",,,
"strict adherence to public health protocols. A WHO surge team of experts, including infectious disease",,,
"specialists and epidemiologists, is currently in South Africa, and is continuing to work with the National",,,
Department of Health.,,,
New weekly cases have risen in Angola from 400 in the week of 7 September to 698 cases in the past,,,
"week, a 74% increase, although the number of new cases has declined by 10% from the past week.",,,
Angola recently upgraded their self-reported transmission classification from ‘clusters of cases’ to,,,
‘community transmission’. Luanda province remains the epicentre with around 90% of all cases. A total,,,
of 16 out of the 18 provinces have reported confirmed cases. WHO has trained around 90 community,,,
health mobilizers now operating across Luanda.,,,

Region of the Americas,,,
A similar incidence of new cases was reported across the Region over the past week (Figure 4) in,,,
"comparison to previous week. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and",,,
Peru registered the highest number of weekly new cases.,,,
The United States of America continues to record approximately 300 000 new cases per week (894 new,,,
"cases per 1 million population). Declines observed over July and August have stagnated in recent weeks,",,,
with several states reporting sharp rises in case numbers – most notably in Midwest states. Canada is,,,
"also showing a large increase in new cases and new deaths compared with last week, at 43% and 208%",,,
"respectively. Likewise, Argentina continues to report an increase in cases and deaths, with cumulative",,,
deaths exceeding 20 000 last week after a backlog of over 3000 reported deaths from Buenos Aires.,,,
"Since peaking at just over 300 000 new weekly cases in the week of 27 July, new cases in Brazil have",,,
fallen to 190 000 new cases in the past week (898 new cases per 1 million population). Weekly new,,,
cases have also fallen in Colombia and Peru.,,,
"In the Region of the Americas, as in other Regions, older persons are far more likely to experience severe",,,
disease following infection. Brazil reported that 76% of COVID-19 related deaths during February to,,,
"September 2020 were in adults aged 60 years and older. In Peru, people over the age of 70 years had",,,
the highest COVID-19 mortality rates during March-May 2020 and estimates from Canada show that,,,
more than 80% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term-care facilities. WHO has published,,,
guidance on Preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services with an annex providing a,,,
"comprehensive set of actions for policymakers, national and local decision-makers and other actors.",,,

"high compared to others in the Region, with over 18 000 new cases in the past week (165 cases per 1",,
"million population). Data as of 29 September shows that 50% of cases are in the age group 20-39 years,",,
while 60% of deaths are in those aged 60 years and over. There is community transmission in all regions,,
"of the country, with three regions - National Capital Region, Region 3, and Region 4A – showing higher",,
"transmission intensity. The National Capital Region continues to report the most cases, with half of",,
"national cases, where Metro Manila mayors have recommended the extension of the general",,
community quarantine status for the month of October.,,
"In Malaysia, the weekly number of new cases has been increasing for the past 3 weeks, with 1319 cases",,
reported in the past week (40 new cases per 1 million population). The state of Sabah has been the,,
"worst affected in recent weeks, accounting for 77% of cases reported in September. A number of",,

clusters in other states have also been linked to travellers from Sabah. Malaysia has a nationwide
recovery movement control order (RMCO) in place and most communities and services are operating
"under these limited restrictions. However, targeted enhanced movement control orders (TEMCO), the"
"most stringent form of community and business restrictions, have been implemented in a number of"
areas with high levels of community transmission.
The Solomon Islands recorded their first COVID-19 case: a student returning from the Philippines on a
repatriation flight. The Solomon Islands have planned to use repatriation flights to return students
"studying in the Philippines and Indonesia. Since early January 2020, WHO has been working closely"
"alongside Pacific Governments and Ministries of Health, in collaboration with partners, to ensure that"
countries are well prepared to respond to the threat of COVID-19.

Key weekly updates,
•,Diagnostics: WHO issued the first and second Emergency Use Listing for a quality antigen based rapid
,diagnostic test. WHO published guidance highlights the value of these tests in areas where community
,transmission is widespread and where nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic testing is either
,"unavailable or where test results are significantly delayed. On 28 September, the Access to COVID-19"
,"Tools (ACT) Accelerator announced 120 million high-quality, affordable COVID-19 antigen rapid tests to"
,be made available to low- and middle-income countries.
•,Diagnostics: WHO published the final version of Target Product Profiles (TPP) for priority diagnostics.
,These TPPs describe the desirable and minimal acceptable profiles for four tests: (i) point of care tests for
,"suspected cases and their close contacts where reference assay testing is unavailable, or turnaround"
,"times obviate clinical utility; (ii) tests for diagnosis or confirmation of acute or subacute infection, suitable"
,for low or high-volume needs; (iii) point of care test for prior infection; and (iv) tests for prior infection for
,moderate to high volume needs.
•,"COVAX: The Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing on 2 October, highlighted 168 have"
,"joined COVAX. Through the ACT Accelerator and COVAX Facility, any vaccines that are proven to be safe"
,and effective will be rolled out equitably across the world.
•,"International Day of Older Persons: On 1 October, the International Day of Older Persons, WHO"
,"launched a package of tools, including a digital application to help health and social workers provide"
,better care for older people . A data portal was also launched that will compile data on global indicators
,"for monitoring the health and well-being of people aged 60 and over. Globally, older persons and those"
,"receiving long term care, accounts for a majority of COVID-19 severe cases and deaths."
•,"Mental Health: Billions of people around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,"
,"which is having an added impact on people’s mental health. On 10 October, World Mental Health Day,"
,WHO is organizing a Big Event for Mental Health. The advocacy event will focus on the urgent need to
,address the world’s chronic under-investment in mental health – a problem that has been thrown into
,the spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•,"Preparedness: During the United Nations General Assembly, a high-level event on ‘Sustainable"
,preparedness for health security and resilience: Adopting a whole-of-society approach and breaking the
,"“panic-then-forget” cycle’ was organized and co-hosted by Finland, France and Indonesia, along with the"
,"WHO. As the world crossed a grim milestone with over a million lives lost to COVID-19, with many more"
,expected to have died from unprecedented disruptions to health systems. The event highlighted the
,need for sustainable health emergency preparedness as COVID-19 will not be the world’s last health
,emergency.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from internationalconveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
