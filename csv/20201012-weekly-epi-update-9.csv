Situation by WHO Region,,
African Region,,
Although the Region had seen a slow but continuous,"decline in newly- reported cases since mid-July,",there
"were 11% more cases reported in the last 7 days compared to the prior week, reaching a total of over 1 200",,
"000 cases (Figure 1, Figure 3). The current figures in the region represent 1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases",,
and 3% of deaths reported worldwide in the past week. The increase in the number of newly- confirmed,,
"cases is partially attributed to the higher number of countries reporting an increase in cases (21 countries),",,
compared to the previous week (14 countries). Although there are a greater number of countries reporting,,
"increases, the pattern of increasing cases is driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, which continue to report the",,
"highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days, followed by Kenya, Uganda, and Algeria. Continuing the",,
"trend from last week, the number of reported deaths increased this week with South Africa accounting for",,
the majority of the new deaths in the Region (74%).,,
The current transmission pattern in the majority of the 47 Member States in the African Region is reported as,,
"community transmission (n=39, 83%), with five reporting clusters of cases, and only Seychelles, Mauritius",,
and Eritrea currently reporting sporadic cases.,,
"South Sudan has reported a decrease in the number of newly -reported cases with an epidemiological link,",,
"with 29% in the past week, compared to 67% the week prior. This is attributed to a decrease in the",,
"proportion of cases that have been detected at a border crossing, where a history of travel can inform an",,
epidemiological link.,,
"This past week, Mozambique registered 795 new cases (25 per million population) bringing the total figure to",,
"almost 10 000 cases. Nevertheless, the country has registered a gradual decline over the last three weeks",,
"including a 39 and 40% decrease in new cases and deaths respectively in the past week, suggesting the",,
epidemic may be slowing down in the country. While the number of tests per 1000 inhabitants has remained,,
"quite stable at 0.3 over the last 10 weeks, the test positivity rate has dropped this week to 9%. Schools have",,
reopened with special measures to prevent further spread of the virus.,,

Surveillance update of the impact of COVID-19 on health workers
"Delivering the diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine interventions for COVID-19, while maintaining essential"
"health services, requires a healthy, trained, competent, equipped, protected, well -managed, and"
appropriately staffed multi-disciplinary healthcare workforce. Health and social care workers both salaried
"and volunteer, face multiple challenges due to COVID-19, leading to either an increased workload or"
absences from work. Challenges include: pre-existing workforce shortages; repurposing of staff to the
COVID-19 response;infections and deaths; quarantine and self-isolation requirements; stress and burn-
"out; shortages of critical equipment and supplies, such as personal protective equipment (PPE);"
inadequate training; labour disputes; and having to care for infected friends and family. A comprehensive
assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on health and social care workers should utilize standardized
"measurements and reporting to adequately qualify the impact. Internationally agreed indicators exist, and"
"they form part of WHO’s ongoing surveillance and communications activities. Health and social workers,"
"in contact with COVID-19 patients and/or who care for COVID-19 patients, are at a higher risk of infection"
"than the general population. Mitigating and reducing this risk, and following WHO guidance (see below),"
is essential.
WHO collects case-based surveillance data from Member States using Case Report Forms (CRFs) via the
"WHO global surveillance for COVID-19. As of 14 September 2020, the CRF database contained 8 233 444"
"forms, representing 28.4% of the cases recorded globally by that date. The CRFs facilitate a descriptive"
"analysis of infections, hospitalizations, clinical outcomes, and sub-population analysis (such as occupation"
notified as health worker).
An analysis of health worker (HW) information was conducted on 281 083 HWs from amongst 1 932 941
"CRFs that indicated HW 1status (23.5% of all CRFs) from 83 countries. These data, covering primarily"
"European and American countries, estimate that around 14% of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO are"
identified as occurring in health workers. There are wide differences in the reported proportion of HW
affected between countries. The overall mean estimate of infections amongst HWs illustrates a clear over
"representation of cases, given that they represent less than 3% of the population, globally, and less than"
8% on average in high income countries.
"Encouragingly, the data indicate that there has been a substantial decline in HW infection since the"
"beginning of the epidemic, independent of the overall change in incidence of cases. In many countries,"
this is likely due to the increased availability of PPE and better adherence to infection prevention and
"control (IPC) guidance. Figure 9 shows monthly trends in HW infection, using data from selected European"
countries 2. The trends show that in the last 3 months prior to the analysis the proportion of cases amongst
HWs was closer to their share of the general population.
"1 For the purposes of the case-based surveillance, ‘health workers’ were defined as those working “any job in a health care setting”."
"2 Datacovering only countries reporting at least 70% of cases in CRF, with at least 70% of CRFs having a known HW status, with at least"
500 HW infections reported.

"Figure 9. Share of health workers amongst total reported infections in selected countries, by month of"
"reporting, March-August 2020"
"The mean age of COVID-19 cases of HWs was 40 years (IQR 31-49), lower than the mean age of non-HWs,"
46 years (IQR 31-60). The distribution of HW infections in women (67%) and men (29%) (4% unknown sex)
is proportionate to the global share of women and men in the health workforce. This is notably different
"from the ratio of infections in females versus males for the general population, where males account for"
53% of cases.
"WHO compared the proportions of COVID-19 case-patients with comorbidities, hospitalization and death"
"as an outcome by age categories and sex in HWs and non-HWs, using information from five countries in"
the Americas and Europe with complete data. A total of 13% (n = 37 446) of HW case -patients reported
"underlying comorbidities (Figure 10), including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, such as"
"hypertension. Of HW case-patients, 5% (n = 15 141) required hospitalization (Figure 11), and of these,"
"5.3% (n = 799) required oxygen therapy. Overall, 0.5% (n = 1417) of the HW cases were fatal (Figure 12)."
"As per the data analyzed, HWs showed a lower proportion of comorbidities, hospitalizations and deaths"
"than non-HWs, even when accounting for age and sex differences between the two populations (see"
figures below). These differences were especially pronounced for those aged 50 years and above.
Further analyses are warranted to explain differences seen between infections in health workers and the
general public.
WHO guidance and resources:
"To support health and social care workers and health facilities in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO"
"has produced guidance on Risk assessment and management of exposure of health care workers, Infection"
"prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease ( COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed,"
"Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19, Rational use of PPE for COVID-19 and considerations"
"during severe shortages, IPC in long-term care facilities, Rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers,"
including key considerations for occupational safety and health; the guidance is being continuously revised
as new scientific information emerges. WHO has also produced a surveillance protocol targeting health
workers who are found positive to COVID-19; as well as a WHO Academy online learning app for COVID-19.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
