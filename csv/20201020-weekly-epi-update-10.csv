Situation by WHO Region,,
African Region,,
"Continuing trends in the previous week, the Region reported an increase in both cases and deaths in the last",,
"7 days, with an 11% increase in new cases and an 8% increase in new deaths (Figure 3). The pattern of",,
"increasing cases continues to be driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, with Kenya, and Botswana also",,
reporting notable increases.,,
"The majority of countries in the region are reporting community transmission of COVID-19 (n=39; 78%), with",,
"a further 7 (14%) classifying transmission as clusters of cases (n=7; 14%), 3 (6%) as sporadic cases, and 1 (2%)",,
as reporting no active cases.,,
"An unusually high number of cases was reported from Botswana this week, with over 1,800 cases reported in",,
"one day. This was largely attributed to a backlog of tests administered from 2–13 October, mostly from in",,
and around the capital city of Gaborone.,,
South Africa has accounted for approximately 70% of deaths in the Region in the past week. The high number,,
"of deaths being reported is partially attributed to a mortality audit, and many of these deaths are",,
retrospectively reported.,,
"Mauritania reported a large increase from last week (12 to 80 cases), all reported from the capital,",,
"Nouakchott. Although this is a higher number of cases than Mauritania has reported in recent weeks, it",,
remains lower than the daily numbers reported in July.,,

Key weekly updates,
•,Therapeutics: The Solidarity Therapeutics Trial have produced conclusive evidence on whether selected
,"repurposed drugs are effective for COVID-19. Interim results from the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial,"
,"coordinated by WHO, indicate that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon"
,regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19
,among hospitalised patients.
•,A call of Solidarity: Kim Sledge and the World We Want have partnered with WHO Foundation to re-record
,"the unity anthem, “We Are Family”, in response to COVID-19 and to bring focus on global public health needs."
,A special edition cover of Sister Sledge’s hit “We Are Family” will be released in a new and inspiring call
,for global solidarity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and to generate proceeds to address the most
,"pressing global health challenges of our time. In support of the song’s release, people worldwide are"
,invited to submit videos of themselves singing We Are Family for inclusion in a compilation video for
,release on 7 December 2020.
•,"Briefings: WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing on 12 October, expressed"
,concern around the concept of reaching so-called “herd immunity” by the letting the virus spread –
,“never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an
,"outbreak, let alone a pandemic. It is scientifically and ethically problematic”. Furthermore, in a media"
,"briefing on 16 October, Dr Tedros highlighted the rising number of cases of COVID-19 globally, especially"
,"in Europe where, although the number of deaths reported is much lower than in March, hospitalisations"
,are increasing.
•,Health System Strengthening: WHO published a Handbook for public health capacity-building at ground
,crossings and cross-border collaboration. The objectives of the handbook are to introduce principles of
,strategic risk assessment for prioritizing preparedness and response capacity building; highlight issues to
,consider when selecting ground crossings for designation under the International Health Regulations
,"(2005, IHR); and, support the establishment and maintenance of cross-border collaboration to improve"
,coordination and communication.
•,"Food security, public health and livelihoods: On 13 October, WHO with the International Labour"
,"Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the International Fund for Agriculture"
,"Development (IFAD) released a joint statement on the Impact of COVID-19 on people's livelihoods, their"
,health and our food systems. The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its
,"fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers"
,"from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers"
,"from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access"
,"to healthy, safe and diverse diets. According to the policy brief published by the United Nations, in the"
,"long run, we face possible disruptions to the functioning of food systems, with severe consequences for"
,health and nutrition.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from international conveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
