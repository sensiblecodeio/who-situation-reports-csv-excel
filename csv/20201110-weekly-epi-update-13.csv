Situation by WHO Region,,
African Region,,
"The number of new cases continues to increase very gradually in the African Region, which reported nearly",,
34 000 new cases and 831 new deaths in the past week. The number of new deaths reported in the last 7,,
"days was 30% higher than it was in the previous week, driven largely by increases seen in South Africa,",,
"Kenya, and Uganda.",,
"South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and deaths in the Region, accounting",,
for nearly a third of new cases and over half of new deaths. The number of new cases reported by,,
"South Africa peaked mid-July, the height of winter, when there were more than 86 000 cases reported",,
"weekly. By September, South Africa was reporting fewer than 15 000 cases per week, and in the past week",,
there were nearly 10 500 cases reported (176 new cases per million population). The number of deaths has,,
"also fallen from over 1 500 deaths per week at the end of July and beginning of August, to 513 deaths",,
reported in the past week (although this is 55% higher than it was in the previous week). As of 31,,
"October, five provinces reported over 80% of cases: Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape,",,
"and Free State. The median age of COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 39 years, and 58% of cases are female.",,
The reason for this higher prevalence among females could be due to females being more represented in,,
"certain occupations in education and health sectors where they may be at greater risk of infection, as well as",,
differences in health seeking behavior.,,
Kenya is reporting the second- highest number of weekly new cases in the African Region. The number of,,
"new cases rose at the end of July, with 4 700 cases in the week beginning 27 July. The number of cases then",,
"has risen considerably in October, rising from 1 000 new cases in the first week of October (28 September-4",,
October) to 6 577 cases (122 new cases per million) in the past week.,,

Key weekly updates,,
•,"As health leaders gather virtually for the resumed 73rd session of the World Health Assembly, WHO has",
,three messages to share:,
,1.,"We can beat COVID-19 with science, solutions and solidarity: many countries and cities have"
,,"successfully prevented or controlled transmission with a comprehensive, evidence-based approach"
,2.,"We must not backslide on our critical health goals: health is the foundation of social, economic and"
,,political stability
,3.,We must prepare for the next pandemic now: countries with robust health emergency preparedness
,,infrastructure have been able to act quickly to contain and control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
•,WHO has published the following documents:,
,o,"An update to the guidance on critical preparedness, readiness and response actions, including further"
,,subclassifications of transmission scenarios within the community transmission category; and updated
,,"guidance on contact tracing, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, public health and"
,,social measures and health services.
,o,An update to the guidance on considerations for implementing and adjusting public health and social
,,measures (PHSM) in the context of COVID-19. PHSM are being implemented and adjused across the
,,globe to limit transmission and reduce mortality and morbidity from COVID-19.
,o,"An update to guidance on health facility assessments, to inform the prioritization of actions and"
,,"decision-making at health facility, subnational and national levels."
,o,The Terms of References for a WHO-convened Global Study of the Origins of SARS-CoV-2. This outlines
,,two phases of studies: Short term studies (Phase 1) will be conducted to better understand how the
,,"virus might have started circulating in Wuhan, China. Building on the findings of these short-term"
,,"studies, and the scientific literature, longer term studies will be developed (Phase 2)."
,o,"A policy brief on readiness for influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provides a concise"
,,summary of information and considerations for key issues policymakers may face. The document also
,,"includes links to relevant guidance and resources for monitoring the situation, preventing seasonal"
,,"influenza, reducing severe complications and mortality, protecting specific populations, and"
,,communicating to and engaging with the public.
•,UNICEF and the World Health Organization issued an urgent call to action to avert major measles and,
,"polio epidemics as COVID-19 continues to disrupt immunization services worldwide, leaving millions of",
,vulnerable children at heightened risk of preventable childhood diseases. WHO estimates that $655,
,million US dollars is needed to address dangerous immunization gaps in children in non-Gavi eligible,
,countries.,
•,WHO and the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities have released a joint statement,
,on the need for improved global regulatory alignment on COVID-19 medicines and vaccines. Therapeutics,
,and vaccines against COVID-19 can only be rapidly approved if applications are supported by robust and,
,sound scientific evidence that allows medicine regulators to conclude on a positive benefit-risk balance,
,for these products.,

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
Global totals include 741 cases and 13 deaths reported from international conveyances.,,,

"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
