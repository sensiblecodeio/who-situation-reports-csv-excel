Situation by WHO Region,,
African Region,,
"With 32 000 new cases and 800 new deaths over the past week, the Region accounts for around 1% of new",,
"global cases and 2% of new global deaths (Table 1). South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia continue to report the",,
highest numbers of new cases. The Region shows a mixed pattern with countries at different epidemic stages,,
"and experiencing different outcomes. Despite this, COVID-19 continues to contribute an added burden to",,
"public health, strained already stretched health systems and caused socio-economic pressures.",,
"Cases in Ethiopia have declined from peaks in August when there were over 10 000 cases a week, to just over",,
"4 400 new cases reported in the past week (38 new cases per 1 million population), a 12% decrease",,
compared to the previous 7 days. The number of new cases in Ethiopia are the third highest in the WHO,,
African region. Deaths in the country have increased slightly (6%) in the past week although overall numbers,,
"remain low (n=73) and the rate of new deaths is less than one (0.6) per 1 million population. Ethiopia, as well",,
"as other countries in the Horn of Africa, are facing a triple threat of floods from unusually heavy rains, desert",,
locust crop destruction and the impacts of COVID-19-all threatening food security.,,
"With 4 594 new cases over the past week (85 new cases per 1 million population), a 51% increase from last",,
"week, Kenya is now reporting the second highest numbers of new cases in the Region and has witnessed a",,
dramatic rise since the week of 28 September when there were only 1 000 new cases reported. It is just shy,,
"of its previous peak at the end of July, when there were 4 700 new cases Although deaths have increased at a",,
much lower rate (9%) and new deaths are just over one per 1 million population (1.3). Oxygen is one of the,,
"most essential medicines for saving patients with COVID-19, as well as many other conditions. One of the",,
"main barriers to medical oxygen is the high transport costs of the cylinders to the health facilities. In Kenya, a",,
private sector company has positioned oxygen plants near clusters of health facilities and uses a milk delivery,,
system to deliver oxygen to more than 140 clinics. WHO is committed to working in solidarity with all,,
"governments, partners and the private sector to scale up sustainable oxygen supply.",,

Region of the Americas,,,
The Region of the Americas reported 880 000 new cases (31% of the global total) and 17 000 new deaths,,,
"(43% of the global total) over the past week. The United States, Brazil, and Argentina continue to report the",,,
highest number of new cases (78% of regional new cases) and new deaths (67% of regional new deaths) in,,,
the Region.,,,
"The number of new weekly cases in the United States has risen since the week beginning 7 September, when",,,
"there were 240 000 confirmed cases, to over 400 000 confirmed cases over the past week. Cases are now",,,
"approaching the previous epidemic peak in July. At 1 318 new cases per million population, the incidence is",,,
"lower in comparison to several European countries, such as the United Kingdom (2 200 cases per million) and",,,
"France (3 300 cases per million). According to a US CDC report, the number of deaths from COVID-19 might",,,
"underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality, with an estimated 300 000 excess deaths",,,
"occurring from late January through 3 October 2020, of which 200 000 excess deaths can be attributed to",,,
COVID-19.,,,
"Colombia has reported just over 1 million cumulative cases since the start of the pandemic, with the number",,,
of weekly new cases remaining stable with approximately 53 000 new cases (1 053 new cases per 1 million,,,
population) and 1 100 new deaths (23 new deaths per 1 million population) reported this week. Cases in,,,
"Colombia peaked in the week of 10 August at 77 915 cases, dropping to 43 000 cases in the week of 28",,,
"September, but have risen in October.",,,
"In the week beginning 28 September, Canada exceeded its previous peak of roughly 12 000 new cases per",,,
"week observed in late April. In October the number of cases has continued to rise, with over 17 000 new",,,
cases in the last week (467 new cases per 1 million population). The number of new deaths per week has,,,
"also risen in October, with 166 deaths reported for the past week, although these numbers are far lower",,,
"than they were in April and May when over 1 000 weekly new deaths were reported. Quebec and Ontario,",,,
"which account for approximately 60% of the population of Canada, account for nearly 80% of cases. There",,,
have been reports suggesting that this rise may be partly attributable to social gatherings during,,,

Western Pacific Region,,,
"Following a three-week increase in the number of cases reported in the Western Pacific region, the number",,,
of weekly new cases decreased by 4% in the last 7 days. The decrease in the number of cases observed was,,,
predominantly driven by the decrease reported in Papua New Guinea (94% decrease) and the Philippines,,,
"(23% decrease). Similarly, the number of deaths reported in the last 7 days decreased by 6%. Approximately",,,
"27 000 cases and 430 deaths were reported in the region, accounting for just 1% of the total number of cases",,,
and deaths reported globally.,,,
"The number of cases and deaths in Malaysia has consistently increased in recent weeks, and in the last 7",,,
"days, an average of 873 cases and 6 deaths were reported daily, amounting to 189 new cases and 1.3 new",,,
deaths per 1 million population. This resulted in an increase of 35% and 64% of cases and deaths respectively,,,
compared with the previous week. The rapid increase in cases and deaths is putting the public health system,,,
under immense pressure.,,,
"Despite the decrease in cases reported in the Philippines, the country accounted for about 50% of the total",,,
number of cases and 75% of the total number of deaths reported in the region in the last 7 days. Relative to,,,
"the country’s population, new cases (123) and new deaths (3) per 1 million population remain low compared",,,
"to other countries in the region. Heavy flooding, affecting over 35 000 households have been reported in the",,,
"island of Mindanao, resulting in the evacuation of more than 12 000 people. This could affect COVID-19",,,

,"expanded that as the northern hemisphere enters winter, cases are accelerating, particularly in Europe and",
,North America. The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track.,
,WHO is calling on governments to carry out five key actions:,
,1.,Assess the current outbreak situation in your country based on the latest data
,2.,"For those countries where cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates are rising, make the necessary"
,,adjustments and course correct as quickly as possible.
,3.,Be clear and honest with the public about the status of the pandemic in your country and what is
,,needed from every citizen to get through this pandemic together.
,4.,Put systems in place to make it easier for citizens to comply with the measures that are advised.
,5.,"Improve contact tracing systems and focus on isolating all cases and quarantining contacts, to avoid"
,,mandatory stay at home orders for everyone.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",,,
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",,,
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",,,

"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
† Other: includes cases reported from internationalconveyances.,
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
