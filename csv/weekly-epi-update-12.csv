Global epidemiological situation,,,,
"In the past week, over 3.3 million new cases have been reported globally (Figure 1). As of 1 November, nearly",,,,
46 million cases and 1.2 million deaths have been reported globally. The further acceleration in the incidence,,,,
"of new cases was most notable in European Region, which reported half of global new cases (over 1.7 million",,,,
"cases - a 22% increase from the previous week. Moreover, the region also reported a substantial rise in the",,,,
"number of new deaths (a 46% increase compared with the previous week), with Europe and the Americas",,,,
now each reporting over 17 000 new deaths in the last 7 days.) The Americas and the Eastern-Mediterranean,,,,
Regions have also seen relatively smaller rises in the number of reported cases. The South-East Asia Region,,,,
"has continued to report a decline in new cases and deaths, while case incidence continues to fluctuate",,,,
around similar rates compared to recent weeks in the African and Western Pacific Regions (Table 1).,,,,

Special Focus: An age and gender analysis of COVID-19
"Based on WHO’s surveillance system, using both case report form data and weekly aggregated data shared by"
"Member States, an analysis has been conducted and is presented here, covering 124 countries from five out"
of six WHO Regions which have provided sufficient data. The data covers the period 31 December 2019 to 18
"October 2020, and includes data on 18 156 074 patients."
Age distribution over time
"Since the start of the pandemic, an increase in the proportion of confirmed cases in younger population groups"
"has been observed over time (Figure 3). Most notably, the proportion of cases among adolescents and young"
adults aged 15-24 years increased from 4% at the beginning of the epidemic (week 9-10) to 14% during week
"42, and those aged 25-64 increased from 50% to 65% over the same period. Slight increases were also observed"
"in the proportion of cases among children aged 0-4 years (from 0.5% to 2%), and 5-14 years (from 1% to 5%)."
"Concurrently, we observed a decrease and then stabilization of the proportion of cases aged 65 years and"
"older, from 40% in the early stages of the epidemic, down to 15% in recent weeks."
"Figure 3: Distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age by epidemiological week reported, combined data"
from WHO Case Report Form and Weekly Aggregate Surveillance Systems as of 18 October 2020
(n = 18 156 074).
"Changes in age distribrution trends are likely linked to several factors, including increased surveillance and"
"access to testing. Early in the pandemic, surveillance and limited testing capacity was often focused on patients"
"with severe disease, who were more likely to be elderly hospitalized patients. Surveilance and testing
capacities were expanded and became more accessible to cases with mild or no symptoms. The decrease in
proportion of elder cases could also be linked to the implementation of infection prevention and control"
"measures in long term care facilities, and an increase in transmission among younger age groups."
The evolution of reported deaths by age (Figure 4) shows a slow increase in the proportion of reported deaths
"aged 25-64 years, ranging from roughly 10% in the early stages, peaking at 30% in the summer, and now"
around 25%. Reported deaths in those aged 65 years and older decreased from close to 90% in the early stages
"to 75% in the most recent weeks. These data support previous observations that older people, who often have"

"co-morbidities, remain the most vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The proportion of reported"
"deaths in the youngest age groups, 0-4 and 5-14 years, remain under 0.2%."
"Critically, while most people with COVID-19 recover after 2 to 6 weeks, there is increasing documentation of"
"the long term effects of COVID-19, including among younger and non-vulnerable groups."
"Figure 4: Distribution of confirmed COVID-19 deaths by age by epidemiological week reported, combined data"
from WHO Case Report Form and Weekly Aggregate Surveillance Systems as of 18 October 2020 (n = 459 943).
Gender distribution
"Our overall data show that men and women each comprise 50% of cases; however, this proportion varies"
"greatly between countries. A higher proportion of cases tends to be observed among men in countries where
men are frequently exposed outside the household as a result of economic factors, or have differential access"
"to testing and healthcare. In countries where women are involved in healthcare and social careers, the"
proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases is higher. These gender differentials can also vary among age groups.
"There is a notable difference in the death rate between sexes, with males accounting for 59% of deaths"
"recorded. Differences in risks of exposure, behavior and risk perception, such as smoking and healthcare-"
"seeking behaviors, as well as differences in some co-morbid conditions, may impact the outcomes of COVID-"
19 and contribute to male–female differences in disease severity.

Situation by WHO Region,,
African Region,,
The African Region continued a four-week trend with a gradual increase in the number of new cases reported,,
"in the past 7 days (Figure 5), reporting almost 33 000 new cases – 1% of new global cases in the past week.",,
"Although the number of new cases has increased slightly , the number of new reported deaths has",,
continued to decline since a spike was observed three weeks ago following the retrospective capturing of a,,
"large number deaths in South Africa. South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia continue to report the highest",,
"numbers of new cases, while the highest number of new deaths per million population in the region was",,
reported by South Africa (6 new cases per million population).,,
"In Nigeria, after a peak in cases at the end of June and in July, weekly new cases have decreased gradually",,
"since September. In the past week, 923 new confirmed cases (4 cases per million population) were reported,",,
while deaths have remained relatively low. Nigeria has a relatively low testing rate and is currently,,
conducting 1.2 diagnostic tests per 10 000 population per week. The test positivity rate has remained,,
relatively stable for the last 7 weeks and is currently 4%.,,
"This past week Uganda recorded a new highest daily increase in COVID-19 cases, with over 430 cases",,
reported on 30 October and close to 1200 cases (26 cases per million population) reported during the week.,,
"With almost half of the new cases reported from the capital, Kampala remains the most affected region.",,
"From the beginning of the epidemic, a total of 862 healthcare workers have been infected and 8 have died",,
"(7% of overall cases and deaths). Health Authorities in Kampala, in collaboration with WHO, are taking a data",,
and equity-oriented approach to the COVID-19 response and city authorities have been assessing the,,
susceptibility of local communities to the impact of the virus with a new COVID-19 vulnerability framework.,,

Key weekly updates,
•,"The fifth meeting of the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee on COVID-19 took place on Thursday, 29"
,October 2020. They advised that the pandemic still constituted aPpublic Health Emergency of
,"International Concern, and urged a focus on response efforts based on lessons learned and g science. The"
,Emergency Committee C provided d advice for WHO and countries to focus on in the coming months and
,expressed appreciation for WHO’s leadership and response activities. It will reconvene in 3 months’ time.
•,"To a significant number of people, COVID-19 poses a range of serious long-term effects, and post COVID-"
,19 symptoms and complications have been reported in both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients.
,"In a media briefing on 30 October, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros said “What’s really concerning is the"
,"vast spectrum of symptoms that fluctuate over time, often overlap and can affect any system in the body."
,"From fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs - including the"
,"lungs and heart, and even neurological and psychological effects. Although we’re still learning about the"
,"virus, what’s clear is that this is not just a virus that kills people. While people do recover, it can be slow –"
,sometimes weeks or months – and it is not always a linear route to recovery.”
•,Several vaccines are now in final phase three trials. If proved safe and effective they will be rolled out
"through the ACT Accelerator’s vaccine arm – the COVAX Facility, which is now supported by 186",
countries. The COVAX Facility is speeding up the search for an effective vaccine for all countries. At the,
"same time, it is supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities, and procuring doses ahead of time",
so that 2 billion doses can be fairly distributed by the end of 2021.,
•,Progress on gender equality has been made in all 12 key areas identified in the 1995 Beijing Declaration
,"and Platform for Action on Women – but for millions of girls and women around the world today, this"
,visionary agenda is still far from reality. The British Medical Journal has commissioned a special series of
,"papers on “Women’s Health and Gender Inequalities” with support from WHO, the Human Reproduction"
,Programme and the United Nations University International Institute for Global Health. The COVID-19
,pandemic is limiting or reversing gains made towards gender equality. WHO strongly urges investment in
,women’s health and is marking the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration with a number of activities.

"Data, table and figure notes",,,
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by,,,
"country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps",,,
"are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and",,,
"caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with",,,
"variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at",,,
"global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag",,,
times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report,,,
combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases; efforts are underway to identify these for notation in,,,
"the data table. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national",,,
"public health authorities, and other sources.",,,
Global totals include 741 cases and 13 deaths reported from international conveyances.,,,

"The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of any",
"opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or",
"of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines",
"on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. Countries,",
territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region.,
The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are,
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.,
"Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital",
letters.,
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council,
"resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been",
aggregated for visualization purposes.,
iTransmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications,
are reviewed on a weekly basis and may be revised as new information becomes available. Differing,
degrees of transmission may be present within countries/territories/areas; classification is based on the,
highest category reported within a country/territory/area. Categories:,
•,No cases: with no confirmed cases;
•,"Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected;"
•,"Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common"
,exposures;
•,Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an
,"assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission"
,chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance; and/or multiple unrelated clusters
,in several areas of the country/territory/area;
•,Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.
ii,"“Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status."
"Country, territory, or area-specific notes, updates and errata",
Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of,
"cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths",
columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be,
"suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes",
and errata for details. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-,
date data.,
